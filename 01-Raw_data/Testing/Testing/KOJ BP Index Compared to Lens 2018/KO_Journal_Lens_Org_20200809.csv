000-189-988-224-76X,Understanding the powerful grouping sense through a unifying classification theory,,1994,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,A. V. Hall,"A unifying theory has been developed that draws together a compatible set of methods for classification, and shows why others should be rejected. The methods reveal polythetic groups and sequences, and evaluate the quality and the best identifying characters for each group. The theory defines the rules for the fuzzy uses of 40 interacting options for group studies in a new 12 000 line FORTRAN program called Uniter, available from the author. The theory and the program's options help to show the nature of the achievements and failures of humanity's powerful grouping sense. This approach offers useful understandings in an extremely wide range of fields, examples of which are given. Both research and teaching should take account of this development",21,3,126,131,Automation; Artificial intelligence; Fortran; Computer science; Unified field theory; Fuzzy logic; Information processing,,,,,,,,,2525837012,,0,,2

These are used to analyse the social and discursive influences that led to a rejection of the DDC as the common classification system for the public libraries in Sweden. The author analyses the debate that took place in the 1910s in various publications and identifies theoretical as well as some practical reasons for rejecting the DDC. Reference is also made to the situation in Norway and Denmark at this time and their attempts to influence Sweden to accept the DDC as had been done in these countries. Conclusions are drawn that the reasons for rejection of the DDC not only is to be sought in theoretical or even practical problems regarding the system itself but in the academic library sector which, through the SAB-system, could create a lasting influence on the knowledge organisation in public libraries in order to uphold the national identity of the Swedish library system",24,3,145,153,Sociology; Library science; Library classification; Disadvantage; National identity; Academic library; Knowledge organisation; Public relations; Knowledge management,,,,,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:292515,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:292515,,,392260780,,0,,1

After examining precedents, we discuss the methodology used and its application. The aim of the project was to provide visibility to information contained in these historical documents which would otherwise have remained inaccessible and to do so in the clearest, most rigorous, and most useful way possible for both the specialized user and the general public. The use of information technology as a management tool is not as common in archives, especially historical archives, as in other documentation areas such as libraries. A pilot project was therefore set up to create an intranet support for managing four specific historical archives containing documents dating from the 13 th to the 20 th centuries. The most important part of this project was that of exploring the viability of constructing a thesaurus to become part of the automated program for archive description and checking.",38,2,153,166,Information technology; Visibility; World Wide Web; Library science; Intranet; Management tool; Computer science; Documentation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-154 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=24274265,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-154,,10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-154,2524040766,,0,,2

Part III : Formats, borrowed terms and omissions",,1996,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Fred W. Riggs,"Third part of a series of articles of which Pt.1 was published in KO 23(1996)No.1, p.25-33, Pt.2 in No.3, p.157-168. Pt.4 will follow in KO 24(1997)No.1. In addition to the important distinctions between the fundamental concepts and terms (tags) used in Onomantics and Terminology, as reported in the first two parts of this essay, several other interesting comparisons can be made. First, with reference to formats, both the structure and nomenclature used for terminological entries (records) in ISO 1087 parallel those found in dictionaries and suggest a semantic rather than an onomantic point of view. Second, a large number of borrowed terms taken from Lexicography and Linguistics can be found in this glossary for the terminology of Terminology. Sometimes the definitions for these terms identify them as borrowed concepts drawn from the vocabulary used by lexicographers. However, sometimes new meanings are stipulated for these terms without any markings to show that they are not borrowed concepts. Moreover, in all these cases, since the original and the newly stipulated concepts are similar, ambiguity is unavoidable. Third, some concepts that might be useful for terminologists are not included in ISO 1087: a few examples are explained. They are all concepts which lexicographers do not need and, consequently, they have no terms for them. It seems apparent that they have been omitted from the vocabulary of Terminology simply because they are new concepts without established terms. To explain the reasons for the formats, terms and omissions found in the leading glossary for the terminology of Terminology takes us into a realm of speculation that is too complicated for inclusion here, but I will discuss it in Part IV of this series, with a focus on the problems of neologisms",23,4,216,224,Epistemology; Applied linguistics; Vocabulary; Realm; Glossary; Ambiguity; Computer science; Linguistics; Speculation; Terminology; Neologism,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-4-216 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2875518,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-4-216,,10.5771/0943-7444-1996-4-216,2472096320,,0,,0

Frequently, objects in these collections present culturally relevant relationships, such as a book about a painting, or a draft or sketch of a famous painting, etc. LOD technology enables such heritage records to be interlinked, achieving interoperability and adding value to digital collections, thus empowering heritage institutions. An aim of this research is characterizing such culturally relevant relationships and organizing them in a vocabulary. Use cases or examples of relationships between objects suggested by curators or mentioned in literature and in the conceptual models as FRBR/LRM, CIDOC CRM and RiC-CM, were collected and used as examples or inspiration of cultural relevant relationships. Relationships identified are collated and compared for identifying those with the same or similar meaning, synthesized and normalized. A set of thirty-three culturally relevant relationships are identified and formalized as a LOD property vocabulary to be used by digital curators to interlink digital collections. The results presented are provisional and a starting point to be discussed, tested, and enhanced. </p>",47,2,122,137,World Wide Web; Vocabulary; Digital collections; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-122,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-122,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-122,3015440969,,0,,0

An e-mail survey was conducted with personnel at LibraryThing, and the results were compared against tags for twenty different fiction books, collected from two different library catalogues with disparate tag cloud sizes, and LibraryThing’s web page. The data were analysed using a modified version of Golder and Huberman’s tag categories (2006). The results show that while LibraryThing claims to only remove the inherently personal tags, several other types of tags are found to have been discarded as well. Occasionally a certain type of tag is included in one book, and excluded in another. The comparison between the two tag cloud sizes suggests that the larger tag clouds provide a more pronounced picture regarding the contents of the book but at the cost of an increase in the number of tags with synonymous or redundant information.</p>",46,4,245,259,Data science; Tag cloud; Computer science; Knowledge management; Moderation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-245,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-245,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-245,2965433880,,0,,0

Pathak,"Attention is drawn to the inadequacies ofthe existing classification schemes as pointed out by individuals and groups concerned with classification research. The article is based on an earlier study by the author, which identified and arranged in a filiatory way the main concepts of sociology and determined their relative significance as headings in a classification scheme The sociology schedule in the Dewey Decimal Classification was examined on the basis of nine evaluation criteria, as e.g. arrangement of major categories, provision for main concepts, use of phrased headings instead of individual key terms, and scattering of related concepts in the schedule. It was found that a large number of the main concepts of sociology are either not represented in the schedule or mentioned in the scope note only along with the main headings. A table shows one hundred main concepts of sociology arranged and classified within ten major categories or sections, and their provision in the DDC. The study suggests that the DDC needs serious reconsideration with regard to the main headings/categories provided as class headings, terminology used for the concepts, the filiatory structure adopted, and the representation of the main concepts of sociology.",22,,148,158,Epistemology; Dewey Decimal Classification; Classification scheme; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Class number; Relative significance; Key terms; Computer science; Terminology; Categorization,,,,,,,,,2503470677,,0,,0

It is founded on the triplet model of concepts. 'This model depicts a concept by means of three kinds of knowledge: a concept base, a concept-representing part and the linkage between them. Informally, the concept base deals with entities subsumed under a concept and their properties and relations. The concept-representing part deals with tools and forms of representing these entities and their properties and relations in some intelligent system. The linkage deals with establishing the proper correspondences between components of the base and the representing part. Each of these knowledge kinds is associated with specific structures related to concepts (symbols, names, statements, images, texts, entities and their properties and relations, procedures of determination of property values, etc.). Various informal and formal (mainly set-theoretical) specifications of these structures serve as criteria for triplet classifications of concepts",24,3,163,175,Data mining; Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Information retrieval; Property value; Computer science,,,,,https://philpapers.org/rec/KUZOTC,https://philpapers.org/rec/KUZOTC,,,108542390,,0,007-626-642-546-03X; 045-040-697-472-007; 047-427-333-660-313; 092-728-395-461-388; 105-401-148-815-682; 133-577-530-187-984; 152-971-415-645-665,6

QALC performs an analysis of documents relying on multi-word term searches and their linguistic variation both to minimize the number of documents selected and to provide additional clues when comparing question and sentence representations. This comparison process also makes use of the results of a syntactic parsing of the questions and Named Entity recognition functionalities. Answer extraction relies on the application of syntactic patterns chosen according to the kind of information that is sought, and categorized depending on the syntactic form of the question.

Devadason; Neelawat Intaraksa; Ponprapa Patamawongjariya; Kavita Desai,"Organizing and providing access to the resources on the Internet has been a problem area in spite of the availability of sophisticated search engines and other software tools. There have been several attempts to organize the resources on the World Wide Web. Some of them have tried to use traditional library classification schemes such as the Library of Congress Classification, the Dewey Decimal Classification and others. However there is a need to assign proper subject headings to them and present them in a logical or hierarchical sequence to cater to the need for browsing. This paper attempts to describe an experimental system designed to organize and provide access to web documents using a faceted pre-coordinate indexing system based on the Deep Structure Indexing System (DSIS) derived from POPSI (Postulate based Permuted Subject Indexing) of Bhattacharyya, and the facet analysis and chain indexing system of Ranganathan. A prototype software system has been designed to create a database of records specifying Web documents according to the Dublin Core and to input a faceted subject heading according to DSIS. Synonymous terms are added to the standard terms in the heading using appropriate symbols. Once the data are entered along with a description and the URL of the web document, the record is stored in the system. More than one faceted subject heading can be assigned to a record depending on the content of the original document. The system stores the surrogates and keeps the faceted subject headings separately after establishing a link. The search is carried out on index entries derived from the faceted subject heading using the chain indexing technique. If a single term is input, the system searches for its presence in the faceted subject headings and displays the subject headings in a sorted sequence reflecting an organizing sequence. If the number of retrieved headings is too large (running into more than a page) the user has the option of entering another search term to be searched in combination. The system searches subject headings already retrieved and looks for those containing the second term. The retrieved faceted subject headings can be displayed and browsed. When the relevant subject heading is selected the system displays the records with their URLs. Using the URL, the original document on the web can be accessed. The prototype system developed in a Windows NT environment using ASP and a web server is under rigorous testing. The database and index management routines need further development.",29,2,65,77,Controlled vocabulary; Library of Congress Classification; Dewey Decimal Classification; Web server; Data mining; World Wide Web; Library classification; Information retrieval; Subject indexing; Computer science; Index term; Search engine indexing,,,,,,,,,2519249569,,0,019-340-375-042-065; 025-651-247-970-399; 049-024-738-718-081; 053-421-725-922-255; 061-042-938-213-428; 070-277-249-353-807; 094-568-885-910-564; 102-669-910-571-199; 103-395-889-409-656; 150-908-378-075-688; 153-597-642-536-484; 158-560-662-702-526; 175-321-858-375-051; 182-499-359-463-219,5

To provide a foundation for research evaluation from the perspective of innovativeness, we propose an automatic approach for extracting innovative ideas from the abstracts of technology and engineering papers. The approach extracts N-grams as candidates based on part-of-speech tagging and determines whether they are novel by checking the Scopus® database to determine whether they had ever been presented previously. Moreover, we discussed the distributions of innovative ideas in different abstract structures. To improve the performance by excluding noisy N-grams, a list of stop-words and a list of research description characteristics were developed. We selected abstracts of articles published from 2011 to 2017 with the topic of semantic analysis as the experimental texts. Excluding noisy N-grams, considering the distribution of innovative ideas in abstracts, and suitably combining N-grams can effectively improve the performance of automatic innovative idea extraction. Unlike co-word and co-citation analysis, innovative-idea extraction aims to identify the differences in a paper from all previously published papers. </p>",46,3,171,186,Information retrieval; Computer science; Knowledge management; Scopus,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-171,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-171,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-171,2955707708,,0,,0

Sharma; Schubert Foo; Miguel A. Morales-Arroyo,"The organisation of knowledge for exploitation and re-use in the modern enterprise is often a most perplexing challenge. The entire knowledge management life-cycle (for example - create, capture, organize, store, search, and transfer) is impacted by the organisation of intellectual capital into a corporate taxonomy or at the least a knowledge map (often incorrectly used interchangeably). Determining the extent to which such an objective is achieved is the focus of what is known as a knowledge audit. In this practice-oriented article, the authors review the fundamentals of creating a taxonomy, the use of meta-data in a necessary process known as classification and the role of expertise locators where the knowledge is not explicit but resides within experts in the form of tacit knowledge. The authors conclude with a framework for developing a corporate taxonomy and how such a project may be executed. The conceptual contribution of this article is the postulation that corporate taxonomies that are designed to facilitate knowledge audits lead to greater organizational impact.",35,1,30,46,Data mining; Organizational learning; Body of knowledge; Personal knowledge management; Domain knowledge; Knowledge mobilization; Tacit knowledge; Corporate taxonomy; Computer science; Knowledge management; Knowledge engineering,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1258162 https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/sfoo/publications/2008/2008Knowledge-Organisation_fmt.pdf http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/sfoo/publications/2008/2008Knowledge-Organisation_fmt.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-1-30,,10.5771/0943-7444-2008-1-30,2257917619,,0,008-114-752-924-078; 017-656-465-905-31X; 020-750-244-497-219; 021-555-019-032-303; 026-787-086-442-120; 026-789-374-196-699; 028-495-225-718-392; 030-136-936-524-671; 039-535-007-979-765; 044-095-698-738-18X; 045-119-187-307-855; 050-405-450-488-904; 072-098-766-057-116; 100-096-010-419-783; 102-747-722-959-349; 111-638-345-430-012; 144-119-328-498-560; 145-873-495-611-066; 199-838-864-346-794,6

This classification system was originally designed for musical instruments and books about instruments, and was first published in German in 1914. Hornbostel-Sachs has dominated organological discourse and practice since its creation, and this article analyses the scheme’s context, background, versions and impact. The position of Hornbostel-Sachs in the history and development of instrument classification is explored. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the mechanics of the scheme, including its decimal notation, the influential broad categories of the scheme, its warrant, and its typographical layout. The version history of the scheme is outlined and the relationships between versions is visualised, including its translations, the introduction of the electrophones category, and the Musical Instruments Museums Online (MIMO) version designed for a digital environment. The reception of Hornbostel-Sachs is analysed, and its usage, criticism and impact are all considered. As well as dominating organological research and practice for over a century, it is shown that Hornbostel-Sachs also had a significant influence on the bibliographic classification of music.",47,1,72,72,German; Library classification; Warrant; Version history; Computer science; Linguistics; Musical; Knowledge management; Decimal; Criticism,,,,,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/22554/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-72,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-72,2971520102,,0,,0

The phenomenon of bias or discrimination in machine ethics is seen as inherited from humans, either through the use of biased data or through the semantics inherent in intellectually-built tools sourced by intelligent agents. The kind of biases observed in AI are compared with those identified in the field of knowledge organization, using religious adherents as an example of a community potentially marginalized by bias. A practical demonstration is given of apparent religious prejudice inherited from source material in a large database deployed widely in computational linguistics and automatic indexing. Methods to address the problem of bias are discussed, including the modelling of the moral process on neuroscientific understanding of brain function. The question is posed whether it is possible to model religious belief in a similar way, so that robots of the future may have both an ethical and a religious sense and themselves address the problem of prejudice. </p>",46,8,596,606,Creativity; Automation; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-596,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-596,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-596,2965597800,,0,,0

Many details are provided on the conceptual equivalence issue, and various ways of dealing with conceptual divergence are described. But when discussing semantic solutions, display options, management issues, or use of technology, specialists and guidelines seldom, if ever, go as far as commenting on whether or not a particular option is truly respectful of a language and its speakers. This paper, based on the premise that in a multilingual thesaurus all languages are equal, reviews the options and solutions offered by the guidelines to the developer of specialized thesauri. It also introduces other problems of a sociocultural, and even of a truly political nature, a prominent feature in the daily life of the thesaurus designer with which the theory and the guidelines do not deal very well",24,2,84,91,World Wide Web; Equivalence (measure theory); Default gateway; Sociocultural evolution; Premise; Multilingualism; Use of technology; Computer science; Knowledge management; Politics,,,,,,,,,2575659789,,0,,14

Muir,"We investigate whether existing knowledge organization systems (KOS) for strong and hesitant forward-looking sentiment could be improved to detect social phenomena. Five judges identified examples of strong/hesitant forward-looking sentiment that were used to compare the KOS developed in the study to existing models. The 'composite' KOS was subsequently applied to annual company reports to generate word frequency and biologically inspired diversity ratios. Critical realism was used as a philosophy to interpret word patterns. Results indicate the composite KOS improved on existing models identified in the literature for strong forward-looking sentiment. In one company, a statistically significant association was found between increasing diversity of assertive forward-looking sentiment and subsequent declining relative business performance. This supported the Pollyanna effect: the social phenomena of over-positive business language in that company. Sharp increases in mentions of the 'future' and 'learnings' were discovered in another company which may be explained by an industrial disaster and subsequent crisis management rhetoric, supporting discourse of renewal theory. This study shows that improvements can be made to existing KOS used to detect forward-looking sentiment in reports. Adopting critical realism as a philosophy when analysing 'big data' may lead to improved theory generation and the potential for differentiating insights.",45,2,152,169,Renewal theory; Rhetoric; Assertiveness; Word lists by frequency; Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences); Knowledge organization; Crisis management; Computer science; Knowledge management; Big data,,,,,https://rgu-repository.worktribe.com/output/247083,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2018-2-152,,10.5771/0943-7444-2018-2-152,2789709778,,0,,1

Archival arrangement represents a form of bricolage that archivists have been practicing for years. By organizing records according to provenance, archivists engage in knowledge creation. Archival theory holds that records are created as an output from social and bureaucratic processes. Archival description, then, could serve as a form of archival record, bearing evidence of the processes of archival arrangement. Current participatory and community-based approaches to archival description urgently require an evidential record of their processes of community consultation and professional mediation. This paper examines two Canadian community-based, participatory archival projects. Project Naming, at Library and Archives Canada, draws upon Inuit community contributions to augment the often sparse and sometimes offensive descriptions of historic photos of arctic peoples. The Sex Work Database at the University of Manitoba, works with sex work activists to create and apply a tagging folksonomy to a collection of websites, organizational records and news media. Analysis of these diverse, community-based projects reveals how current approaches to description make it difficult to distinguish between professional and community contributions to arrangement and description, and proposes ways to make such contributions more apparent. </p>",46,7,502,521,Knowledge organization; Knowledge creation; Community participation; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-502,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-502,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-502,3000708489,,0,,0

Authorial stance has been widely studied in linguistics and is a typical feature of scientific writing that reveals the uniqueness of each author's perspective, their scientific contribution, and their thinking. We argue that authorial stance guides the reading of scientific documents and that it can be used to characterize the knowledge contained in such documents. Our research has previously shown that people reading dissertations are interested both in a topic and in a document's authorial stance. Now, we would like to propose a two-tiered indexing system. Dissertations would first be divided into paragraphs; then, each information unit would be defined by topic and by the markers of authorial stance present in the document.",39,4,292,299,World Wide Web; Scientific writing; Computer science; Search engine indexing,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2012-4-292 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=26220887,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2012-4-292,,10.5771/0943-7444-2012-4-292,2528165389,,0,,5

Smiraglia,"NARCIS—National Academic Research and Collaborations Information System-- is the national research portal for the Netherlands’ data and research archiving, which is governed by its own NARCIS Classification. The current instantiation of the classification dates from 2015. The classification is currently made up of two classes—D for the sciences broadly, and E for interdisciplinary areas. The NARCIS Classification is designed specifically and with care for the contents of the NARCIS data portal. The classification mostly represents the sciences. A few anomalous situations are visible in the ontology of the classification: the humanities occupy one division within the sciences, placed between the life sciences and law; and, the treatment of interdisciplinarity, for which a separate class E is set aside for interdisciplinary sciences. A dump of the NARCIS database was used to analyze the population of the NARCIS classification. The life sciences occupy 34% of the NARCIS database. A framework for research networking systems reveals the NARCIS database and its classification most objectives, with the only lapse being the output of entities and attributes to ontologies. The NARCIS Classification is also an occupational classification. The NARCIS classification supports a vital research portal that, in turn, supports a nationally-coordinated research effort designed to provide better inter-institutional communication of scholarly productivity, thus is in itself an information institution, in which domain-dependence is part of its cultural imperative. The NARCIS Classification incorporates an example of top-down politics in which funded disciplines are included and best represented. A perhaps unintended consequence is the encapsulation of forced views. Trajectories for further discussion with regard to continued development of the NARCIS Classification include identity, interoperability, interdisciplinarity, and synthesis.",46,5,337,344,Encapsulation (computer programming); Ontology (information science); Information system; Interoperability; Data science; Ontology; Population; Data portal; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.knaw.nl%3Apublications%2Faad2ccce-1ec5-4916-a07e-0ac22a604275,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-5-337,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-5-337,2969349949,,0,,1

His main interest is classification theory. He has published papers on this subject in several international journals and conference pro- ceedings. He is member of the scientific advisory boards of the Universal Decimal Classification Con- sortium (UDCC) and of the journal Knowledge Organization, and vice-president of the International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO). Gnoli, Claudio. Classification Transcends Library Business. Knowledge Organization, 37(3), 223-229. 26 references. Abstract: Although bibliographic classifications usually adopt a perspective different from that of object classifications, the two have obvious relationships. These become especially relevant when users are looking for knowledge scattered in a wide va- riety of forms and media. This is an increasingly common situation, as library catalogues now coexist in the global digital envi- ronment with catalogues of archives, of museums, of commercial products, and many other information resources. In order to make the subject content of all these resources searchable, a broader conception of classification is needed, that can be applied to any knowledge item, rather than only bibliographic materials. To illustrate this we take an example of the research on bag- pipes in Northern Italian folklore. For this kind of research, the most effective search strategy is a cross-media one, looking for many different knowledge sources such as published documents, police archives, painting details, museum specimens, organi- zations devoted to related subjects. To provide satisfying results for this kind of search, the traditional disciplinary approach to classification is not sufficient. Tools are needed in which knowledge items dealing with a phenomenon of interest can be re- trieved independently from the other topics with which it is combined, the disciplinary context, and the medium where it oc- curs. This can be made possible if the basic units of classification are taken to be the phenomena treated, as recommended in the Leon Manifesto, rather than disciplines or other aspect features. The concept of bagpipes should be retrievable and browsable in any combination with other phenomena, disciplines, media etc. Examples are given of information sources that could be managed by this freely-faceted technique of classification.",37,3,223,229,Folklore; Data mining; Universal Decimal Classification; Library classification; Painting; Data science; Manifesto; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Phenomenon; Discipline,,,,,https://www-dimat.unipv.it/gnoli/gnoli2010.pdf http://www-dimat.unipv.it/gnoli/gnoli2010.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2010-3-223,,10.5771/0943-7444-2010-3-223,2183630767,,0,007-154-405-661-138; 009-250-243-917-382; 009-859-469-551-600; 033-203-507-437-875; 046-308-014-520-294; 062-493-798-375-845; 068-112-917-094-066; 093-118-965-830-64X; 093-342-291-216-462; 098-507-725-113-618; 110-269-455-474-000; 122-667-315-891-776; 122-746-647-303-059; 127-482-211-718-005; 190-947-914-672-957; 193-627-707-985-201,10

The paper outlines recent conceptual moves in knowledge organization re- search and shows that contemporary classification theory is based on a pragmatic understanding of the world. It suggests that unjust state- ments and assumptions about the world challenge contemporary library classifications and that a proper response is needed. It outlines a framework for the development of ethical classifications based on MacIntyre's practice-based ethical theory. It provides a framework within which editors and managers of library classifications can make ethically sound decisions.,40,4,242,253,Political science; Morality; Knowledge organization; Ethical theory; Management science; Engineering ethics; Knowledge management,,,,,http://jenserikmai.info/Papers/2013_Ethics.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2013-4-242,,10.5771/0943-7444-2013-4-242,2340829411,,0,007-452-417-696-587; 009-307-159-811-053; 010-666-201-096-349; 011-389-959-101-643; 025-945-792-658-628; 029-275-535-129-990; 032-388-474-318-614; 042-401-029-005-536; 042-965-285-376-401; 045-643-328-405-899; 054-767-050-361-481; 058-870-933-249-646; 059-438-671-773-803; 062-058-206-673-640; 064-979-192-032-082; 080-945-058-659-719; 081-562-866-534-429; 083-103-671-012-428; 087-831-676-456-440; 089-285-072-653-723; 103-101-119-589-404; 120-964-024-592-598; 123-985-997-137-067; 125-568-022-593-703; 133-244-016-296-955; 135-120-936-631-160; 142-521-850-154-819; 148-571-180-308-199; 151-573-269-790-142; 158-161-971-700-796; 173-558-572-143-805; 186-320-819-181-283,15

031-740-156-435-499,Indexing of musical genres. An epistemological perspective,,2003,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Knut Tore Abrahamsen,"This article sets out to investigate genre as a basic criterion in subject indexing of music in libraries and bibliographical databases. The concept of genre is examined in relation to epistemology and to different values and views in both musicology and libraries. The point of departure is to regard music as a domain of actors, institutions and processes. A comprehensive definition of this domain is suggested, which includes several subdomains and discourses. The classical music subdomain and the popular music subdomain are introduced and related to libraries. The article further investigates the concept of paradigm in relation to musicology. It demonstrates how two different paradigms influence the way music is defined, described, classified and indexed and how they are part of a historical context. The fourth part of the article focuses on the concept of genre and the analysis of music and the relation between analytical methods and values/paradigms. In addition, this part focuses on the actors that are responsible for the verbalization of genres in music. The fifth part examines indexing of musical genres with a view to their function as subject access points in databases. The unsatisfactory state of today's practice, as well as the need of a better theoretical foundation of the concept of genre, is documented. The unsatisfactory differentiation in the organising of popular music is exemplified by Danish and Norwegian libraries, including the DK5 system and the Indeksering afmusik guidelines. Finally, arguments are put forward for developing an anthropological paradigm in relation to organizing music in libraries.",30,,144,169,Epistemology; Popular music; Sociology; Musicology; Subject indexing; Subject access; Linguistics; Classical music; Musical; Biomusicology; Music history,,,,,,,,,2488385637,,0,,20
032-050-236-233-836,Human-centric Faceted Approach for Ontology Construction,2020-04-22,2020,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Shiv Shakti Ghosh; Subhashis Das; Sunil Kumar Chatterjee,"<p>In this paper, we propose an ontology building method, called human-centric faceted approach for ontology construction (HCFOC). HCFOC uses the human-centric approach, improvised with the idea of selective dissemination of information (SDI), to deal with context. Further, this ontology construction process makes use of facet analysis and an analytico-synthetic classification approach. This novel fusion contributes to the originality of HCFOC and distinguishes it from other existing ontology construction methodologies. Based on HCFOC, an ontology of the tourism domain has been designed using the Protégé-5.5.0 ontology editor. The HCFOC methodology has provided the necessary flexibility, extensibility, robustness and has facilitated the capturing of background knowledge. It models the tourism ontology in such a way that it is able to deal with the context of a tourist’s information need with precision. This is evident from the result that more than 90% of the user’s queries were successfully met. The use of domain knowledge and techniques from both library and information science and computer science has helped in the realization of the desired purpose of this ontology construction process. It is envisaged that HCFOC will have implications for ontology developers. The demonstrated tourism ontology can support any tourism information retrieval system. </p>",47,1,31,44,Data science; Ontology construction; Human centric; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-31,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-31,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-31,3018552045,,0,,0

An overview is presented of the essential elements of critical race theory, including clarifications of the meanings of some important terms such as “race” and “social justice.” On the basis of a review of existing conceptions of the just and the antiracist library service, a rationale is presented for hypothesizing that critical race theory may be of use to the library and information sciences. The role of classification schemes as information institutions in their own right is established, and the Dewey Decimal Classification is introduced as the case to be studied. The challenges faced by classification-scheme designers in the construction and/or reconstruction of race-related categories are reviewed; and an analysis is presented of one sense in which it might be suggested that recent (2003) revisions in one of the DDC’s tables appear not to meet those challenges wholly successfully. An account is given of a further sense in which adoption of a critical race-theoretic approach has the more radical effect of calling into question a fundamental decision recently taken to “deracialize” the DDC. In conclusion, an assessment is made of critical race theory as a framework for evaluating library classification schemes.",34,3,144,168,Epistemology; Dewey Decimal Classification; Classification scheme; Racism; Sociology; Library classification; Critical race theory; Service information; Information science,,,,,https://works.bepress.com/furner/14/ https://works.bepress.com/furner/14/download/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2007-3-144,,10.5771/0943-7444-2007-3-144,2128385741,,0,005-855-262-964-375; 013-710-360-492-466; 019-725-389-896-835; 023-415-661-258-48X; 028-908-906-309-044; 029-041-684-554-50X; 031-569-098-270-093; 033-898-669-534-938; 046-843-911-802-501; 048-138-748-732-150; 051-205-335-136-823; 056-798-318-790-928; 058-582-509-007-852; 059-248-758-802-999; 059-438-671-773-803; 064-979-192-032-082; 067-864-293-420-163; 070-814-769-721-563; 072-562-174-683-531; 084-806-549-347-002; 089-039-641-726-029; 091-092-189-619-757; 093-342-291-216-462; 098-167-914-533-752; 124-644-779-996-614; 124-670-931-800-743; 130-310-027-965-441; 141-127-501-591-306; 142-255-262-450-284; 148-571-180-308-199; 154-178-816-668-461; 159-184-001-397-050; 161-019-767-227-71X; 174-812-603-865-761; 176-594-815-080-114; 185-402-672-734-56X; 185-953-741-131-799; 186-320-819-181-283; 189-770-651-771-913,36

032-707-667-937-548,UDC in subject gateways: experiment or opportunity?,,2006,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Aida Slavic,"The paper gives a short overview of the history of use of UDC in Internet subject gateways (SGs) with an English interface, from 1993 to 2006. There were in total, nine quality controlled SGs that were functional for shorter or longer periods of time. Their typology and functionality is described. Quality SGs have evolved and the role of classification has changed accordingly from supporting subject organization on the interface and automatic categorization of resources, towards supporting a semantic linking, control and vocabulary mapping between different indexing systems in subject hubs and federated SGs. In this period, many SGs ceased to exist and little information remains available regarding their status. SGs currently using UDC, for some part of their resource organization, do not use a UDC subject hierarchy at the interface and its role in resource indexing has become more difficult to observe. Since 2000, UDC has become more prevalent in East European SGs, portals and hubs, which are outside the scope of this research.

It is necessary to develop CS taxonomy research to combine its historical perspective, its current knowledge and its predicted future trends - including all breakthroughs in information and communication technology. In this paper we have analyzed the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) by means of visualization maps. The important achievement of current work is an effective visualization of classified documents from the ACM Digital Library. From the technical point of view, the innovation lies in the parallel use of analysis units: (sub)classes and keywords as well as a spherical 3D information surface. We have compared both the thematic and semantic maps of classified documents and results presented in Table 1. Furthermore, the proposed new method is used for content-related evaluation of the original scheme.

Satija,"Sears List of Subject Headings (Miller and McCarthy 2010), first published in 1923, is now in its 20 th edition. Like most subject headings lists, apart from being a list of preferred (and non-preferred) headings, it also provides patterns, clear instructions, and examples for coining new subject headings not explicitly listed. Key headings form a vital part of the system of coining new headings. It is proposed that more key headings should be designated. Some candidate headings are described. One far-reaching provision seems to be the use of a subdivision of a preferred heading with all of its NTs. Thus, every preferred heading is a potential key heading for all of its NTs. This proposal works on the principle that what is true of a class is true of its narrower classes of all types.

The primary challenge in the analysis of fictional content is that there is no single meaning to be analysed; the analysis is an ongoing process involving an interaction between the text produced by author, the reader and the society in which the interaction occurs. Furthermore, different audiences have specific needs to be taken into consideration. This article explores the topic of fiction knowledge organization, including both classification and indexing. It provides a broad and analytical overview of the literature as well as describing several experimental approaches and developmental projects for the analysis of fictional content. Traditional fiction indexing has been mainly based on the factual aspects of the work; this has then been expanded to handle different aspects of the fictional work. There have been attempts made to develop vocabularies for fiction indexing. All the major classification schemes use the genre and language/culture of fictional works when subdividing fictional works into subclasses. The evolution of shelf classification of fiction and the appearance of different types of digital tools have revolutionized the classification of fiction, making it possible to integrate both indexing and classification of fictional works.</p>",46,4,320,332,Data mining; Information retrieval; Computer science; Search engine indexing,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-320,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-320,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-320,2965350711,,0,,0

These large image collections need to be properly stored, organized and easily retrieved. Tags have a key role in image retrieval but it is difficult for those who upload the images to also undertake the quality tag assignment for potential future retrieval by others. Relying on professional keyword assignment is not a practical option for large image collections due to resource constraints. Although a number of content-based image retrieval systems have been launched, they have not demonstrated sufficient utility on large-scale image sources on the web, and are usually used as a supplement to existing text-based image retrieval systems. An alternative to professional image indexing can be social tagging -- with two major types being photo-sharing networks and image labeling games. Here we analyze these applications to evaluate their usefulness from the semantic point of view. We also investigate whether social tagging behaviour can be managed. The findings of the study have shown that social tagging can generate a sizeable number of tags that can be classified as interpretive for an image, and that tagging behaviour has a manageable and adjustable nature depending on tagging guidelines.",41,1,57,65,World Wide Web; Image retrieval; Visual Word; Automatic image annotation; Information retrieval; Image labeling; Resource constraints; Computer science; Upload; Search engine indexing,,,,,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/3581/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2014-1-57,,10.5771/0943-7444-2014-1-57,2145431042,,0,005-340-738-859-691; 008-202-966-214-573; 008-666-732-909-001; 012-975-335-842-302; 014-859-042-086-907; 015-582-513-272-43X; 018-521-790-216-719; 018-886-711-873-182; 021-451-734-318-865; 022-566-774-755-898; 022-603-518-849-430; 028-793-965-862-483; 031-400-156-663-247; 032-440-314-340-754; 048-621-198-783-390; 052-514-557-235-718; 057-483-489-928-039; 057-569-973-944-388; 061-698-653-620-056; 064-081-574-764-00X; 078-303-924-945-302; 081-335-225-857-914; 084-657-279-171-062; 084-822-179-417-818; 088-272-054-932-172; 088-316-988-774-405; 110-115-620-035-238; 112-791-209-879-015; 113-663-971-294-22X; 121-229-484-638-45X; 123-886-781-929-504; 125-912-533-921-65X; 150-039-961-910-888; 185-708-915-538-371,5

López-Huertas,"The research dynamics of knowledge organization (KO) show a tendency towards the reformulation of previous questions in the new technology-driven and interdisciplinary context of KO. Current research questions in KO are dominated by a noteworthy interest in quality, related not only to the informational contents recorded in knowledge organization systems (KOS) but also to technical and technological considerations. The integration of knowledge would seem to constitute a quality indicator present in most proposals, and it also responds to the need for KOS with frameworks comprehensible for all user sectors, respecting the diversity of users. The flip side of knowledge integration entails the conjugation of technical, formal and technological aspects, well represented by the word interoperability, or the search for a way to simplify and harmonize the great variety of structures and formats that coexist in the Internet. This paper addresses the aforementioned major research concerns expressed in the last decade of KO literature. It is structured into two broad sections: 1) A demand for quality, touching on research questions related to multilingualism, cross-culturalism, social groups, minorities and ethics, as well as the integration of structures, forms and formats and the respective proposals by scholars; and 2) A demand for managing emergent knowledge in KOS, with a discussion of how to represent and organize work-oriented and organizational knowledge domains, where multidimensional knowledge (multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinarity) is addressed together with the responses put forth by various researchers.",35,2-3,113,136,The Internet; Social group; Interoperability; Information policy; Knowledge organization; Multilingualism; Research questions; Computer science; Knowledge integration; Knowledge management,,,,,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=20613688,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-113,,10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-113,59344961,,0,,19

Sawsaa; Joan Lu,"Creation and development of formal domain ontology of Occupational Therapy (OTO) requires the prescription and formal evaluation of the results through specific criteria. UPON Methontology of development ontologies was followed to create OTO ontology, and was implemented by using Protege-OWL. Accuracy of OTO ontology was assessed using a set of ontology design criteria. This paper describes a software engineering approach to model domain ontology for occupational therapy resources (OTO) using Natural Language Programming (NLP) technology. The rules were written to annotate the domain concepts using Java Annotation Patterns Engine (JAPE) grammar. It is used to support regular expression matching and thus annotate OT concepts by using the GATE developer tool. This speeds up the time-consuming development of the ontology, which is important for experts in the domain who face time constraints and high workloads. The rules provide significant results: the pattern matching of OT concepts based on the lookup list produced 403 correct concepts and the accuracy was generally higher. Using NLP technique is a good approach to reducing the domain expert’s work, and the results can be evaluated. This study contributes to the understanding of ontology development and evaluation methods to address the knowledge gap of using ontology in the decision support system component of occupational therapy.",41,6,452,464,Ontology Inference Layer; Data mining; Process ontology; Artificial intelligence; Ontology (information science); Natural language processing; Ontology-based data integration; Ontology; Computer science; Suggested Upper Merged Ontology; Upper ontology; Ontology alignment,,,,,http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/24354/ https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/publications/using-natural-language-programming-nlp-technology-to-model-domain,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2014-6-452,,10.5771/0943-7444-2014-6-452,279842699,,0,,0

Moeller; Kim Becnel,"<p>Through their work as instructors in a master of library science program, the authors observed a sharp increase in students’ desire to adopt the reader-interest classification approach of genrefication for their school libraries’ fiction collections. In order to better understand this trend, the researchers interviewed seven school librarians regarding their motivations for genrefying their libraries’ fiction collections; the challenges they encountered during or after the genrefication process; and any benefits they perceived as having resulted in the implementation of genrefication. The data suggest that the librarians’ interests in genrefication stem mostly from the lack of time they have to help individual students find materials, and the lack of time students are given out of the instructional day to explore the libraries’ fiction collections. The participants felt that reclassifying the library’s fiction collection by genre gave students more ownership of the fiction collection and allowed them to find materials that genuinely interested them. The significant challenges the librarians faced in the reorganization process speak to challenges regarding the ways in which librarians attempt to provide access to diverse materials for all patrons. </p>",46,3,199,208,World Wide Web; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-199,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-199,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-199,2953445755,,0,,0

It contracts the classes on Christianity, 220-280, into one class, 220, and allows for local Korean emphasis so that religions of Asian, and especially East Asian, origin are given preferred treatment. It relocates Buddhism and other religions of Asian origin into separate divisions, 230 and 240, respectively. The recommendations maintain the basic system and order of DDC. Whenever possible, they adhere to the Korean Decimal Classification in the arrangement of religions of Asian origin. Because the options for religions other than Christianity in DDC are to give preferred treatment to a specific religion, this article tries to generalize the idea to suggest an option in DDC as Option F for > 292-299 Religions other than Christianity, for other nations in the world having similar situations.

R. Ranganathan for knowledge classification and for the design of a facet scheme of library classification, and the Entity-Relationship Data Modelling and Analysis Approach set by Peter Pin-Sen Chen; both further modified by other experts. Efforts have been made to show the parallelism between the two approaches. It points out that, both the theoretical approaches are concerned with the organisation of knowledge or information, and apply almost similar theoretical principles, concepts, and techniques for the design and development of a framework for the organisation of knowledge, information, or data, in their respective domains. It states that both the approaches are complementary and supplementary to each other. The paper also argues that Ranganathan's postulations based approach or analytico-synthetic approach to knowledge classification can be applied for developing efficient data retrieval systems in addition to the data analysis and modelling domain.",30,1,1,19,Entity–relationship model; Data mining; Library classification; Chen; Faceted classification; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Data retrieval; Data modeling; Information science,,,,,,,,,2501615441,,0,,5

To this end, the salient features of taxonomies are identified and their scope, nature, and role are further elaborated based on an extensive literature review. In the meantime, the connection and distinctions between taxonomies and classification schemes and thesauri are also identified, and the rationale that taxonomies are chosen as a viable knowledge organization system used in organization-wide websites to support browsing and aid navigation is clarified.",33,3,160,169,Data mining; Classification scheme; Knowledge organization system; Knowledge organization; Salient; Content organization; Computer science; Knowledge management; Grey literature,,,,,,,,,194667454,,0,,11

Such is the case despite compelling evidence of the desirability and profundity of leisure in human life. This article introduces one popular form of leisure, hobbies, as a potentially provocative topic for LIS scholarship. To facilitate research on information within hobbies, the article discusses two conceptual devices: Serious leisure (Stebbins, 1982) describes essential characteristics of leisure, establishes that some types are information-rich, and provides a framework to study leisure systematically; The collectivist theory of domain analysis (Hjorland and Albrechtsen, 1995) orients research to the hobby milieu and its objective information forms, recasting them as hobby domains. As an example of the application of both devices, a case study is reviewed of the information resources in the hobby of cooking. The article closes with a call to action and suggested research program for the study of hobbies in LIS.",30,,228,238,Call to action; Sociology; Research program; Scholarship; Frontier; Hobby; Human life; Social science; Public relations; Knowledge management; Information science; Collectivism,,,,,https://works.bepress.com/jenna_hartel/32/download/ https://works.bepress.com/jenna_hartel/32/,https://works.bepress.com/jenna_hartel/32/,,,1524307444,,0,,85

048-127-750-639-998,UDC and folksonomies,,2010,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Alenka Šauperl,"Social tagging systems, known as ‘folksonomies’, represent an important part of web resource discovery as they enable free and unrestricted browsing through information space. Folksonomies consisting of subject designators (tags) assigned by users, however, have one important drawback: they do not express semantic relationships either hierarchical or associative between tags. As a consequence, the use of tags to browse information resources requires moving from one resource to another, based on coincidence and not on the pre-established meaningful or logical connections that may exist between related resources. We suggest that the semantic structure of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) may be used in complementing and supporting tag-based browsing. In this work, two specific questions were investigated: (1) Are terms used as tags in folksonomies included in the UDC? and (2) Which facets of UDC match the characteristics of documents or information objects that are tagged in folksonomies? A collection of the most popular tags from Amazon, LibraryThing, Delicious and 43Things was investigated. The universal nature of UDC was examined through the universality of topics and facets covering diverse human interests which are at the same time interconnected and form a rich and intricate semantic structure.

These tags (also called concepts, categories, facets or entities) can be used to classify web resources and to express users' preferences. Folksonomy-based systems allow users to classify web resources through tagging bookmarks, photos or other web resources and saving them to a public web site like Del.icio.us. Thus information about web resources and online articles can be shared in an easy way. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the folksonomy tagging phenomenon (also called social tagging and social bookmarking) and explore some of the reasons why we need controlled vocabularies, discussing the problems associated with folksonomy.",33,4,199,203,Controlled vocabulary; Information management; World Wide Web; Information retrieval; Folksonomy; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Social Semantic Web; Web navigation; Web resource; Web development,,,,,http://eprints.rclis.org/10307/,http://eprints.rclis.org/10307/,,,1524856547,,0,013-932-222-386-140; 045-140-042-699-604; 047-925-942-219-314; 075-546-520-342-991,32

Given its inherent interdisciplinarity, we ask what might a map of the physical, cultural, and intellectual geography of the KO community look like? Who is participating in this discipline’s scholarly discussion, and from what locations, both geographically and intellectually? Using the unit of authorship in the journal Knowledge Organization, where is the nexus of KO activity and what patterns of authorship can be identified? Cultural characteristics were applied as a lens to explore who is and is not participating in the international conversation about KO. World Bank GNI per capita estimates were used to compare relative wealth of countries and Hofstede’s Individualism dimension was identified as a way of understanding attributes of countries whose scholars are participating in this dialog. Descriptive statistics were generated through Excel, and data visualizations were rendered through Tableau Public and TagCrowd. The current project offers one method for examining an international and interdisciplinary field of study but also suggests potential for analyzing other interdisciplinary areas within the larger discipline of information science. </p>",46,8,578,589,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-578,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-578,,,0,,0

These three presumptions are the notion of mutually exclusive categories, teleology in the sense of linear progression toward a goal, and hierarchy both through logical division and through the dominance of some classes over others. These three presumptions are linked to classificatory thought in the western tradition. The purpose of making these connections is to investigate the cultural specificity to western culture of widespread classificatory practice. It is a step in a larger study to examine classification as a cultural construction that may be systemically incompatible with other cultures and with marginalized elements of western culture.",26,2,65,73,Epistemology; Sociology; Presupposition; Praxis; Sophist; Foucauldian discourse analysis; Hierarchy; Classical logic; Western culture; Teleology,,,,,,,,,2481275076,,0,,29

Multimedia information retrieval as a problem represents a significant challenge to machine learning as a technological solution, but some problems can still be addressed by using appropriate AI techniques. We review the technological developments and provide a perspective on the use of machine learning in conjunction with knowledge organization to address multimedia IR needs. The semantic gap in multimedia IR remains a significant problem in the field, and solutions to them are many years off. However, new technological developments allow the use of knowledge organization and machine learning in multimedia search systems and services. Specifically, we argue that, the improvement of detection of some classes of low-level features in images music and video can be used in conjunction with knowledge organization to tag or label multimedia content for better retrieval performance. We provide an overview of the use of knowledge organization schemes in machine learning and make recommendations to information professionals on the use of this technology with knowledge organization techniques to solve multimedia IR problems. We introduce a five-step process model that extracts features from multimedia objects (Step 1) from both knowledge organization (Step 1a) and machine learning (Step 1b), merging them together (Step 2) to create an index of those multimedia objects (Step 3). We also overview further steps in creating an application to utilize the multimedia objects (Step 4) and maintaining and updating the database of features on those objects (Step 5). </p>",47,1,45,55,World Wide Web; Multimedia information retrieval; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-45,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-45,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-45,2966065066,,0,,0

Works are mentefacts-intellectual (or mental) constructs that serve as artifacts of the cultures in which they arise. The meaning of a work is abstract at every level, from its creator’s conception of it, to its reception and inherence by its consumers. Works are a kind of informing object and are subject to the phenomenon of instantiation, or realization over time. Research has indicated a base typology of instantiation. The problem for information retrieval is to simultaneously collocate and disambiguate large sets of instantiations. Cataloging and bibliographc tradition stipulate an alphabetico-classed arrangement of works based on an authorship principle. FRBR provided an entity-relationship schema for enhanced control of works in future catalogs, which has been incorporated into RDA. FRBRoo provides an empirically more precise model of work entities as informing objects and a schema for their representation in knowledge organization systems.</p>",46,4,308,319,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-308,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-308,,,0,,0

Chen; N. J. Ford,"The rapid evolution of hypermedia technology makes it possible to access an immense volume of information in an educational setting, This research examines the relationship between individual differences (in particular, cognitive styles) and navigation strategies using a WWW-based hypermedia learning system. The hypermedia learning system was used at Sheffield University's Department of Information Studies. Twenty Masters students were pre-tested for their cognitive styles. Dependent variables included navigation patterns, selection of navigation tools, and reactions to the hypermedia system. The results indicated that students with differing cognitive styles and individual characteristics selected different access facilities and applied different navigation patterns. The implication of these findings and the role of individual differences in designing hypermedia-based learning systems are discussed.",25,3,67,78,Navigational instrument; Cognitive style; Variables; Hypermedia; Computer science; Multimedia,,,,,,,,,1267856490,,0,,14

Both areas are outlined and their specific contents shown. Also a survey of its special subfields is given. The science-theoretical foundation of Knowledge Organization as a new scientific discipline is based on the propositional concept of science. Within a universal system of the sciences, KO has been regarded as a subfield of Science of Science. Concludingly it is proposed to find the necessary institution for work in concerted effort of scientists, knowledge organizers and terminologists on the collection, definition, and systematization of concepts of all subject fields, utilizing the Information Coding Classification (ICC) as the necessary categorizing structure.",33,1,11,19,Knowledge organization; Information coding; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,,,,,2522313107,,0,,40

I. Kipp,"This paper examines the context of online indexing from the viewpoint of three different groups: users, authors, and professional indexers. User tags, author keywords and descriptors were collected from academic journal articles, which were both indexed in Pubmed and tagged on CiteULike, and analysed. Descriptive statistics, informetric measures, and thesaural term comparison shows that there are important differences in the use of keywords between the three groups in addition to similarities which can be used to enhance support for search and browse. While tags and author keywords were found that matched descriptors exactly, other terms which did not match but provided important expansion to the indexing lexicon were found. These additional terms could be used to enhance support for searching and browsing in article databases as well as to provide invaluable data for entry vocabulary and emergent terminology for regular updates to indexing systems. Additionally, the study suggests that tags support organisation by association to task, projects and subject while making important connections to traditional systems which classify into subject categories.",38,3,245,261,Data mining; Information retrieval; Vocabulary; Lexicon; Descriptive statistics; Computer science; Terminology; Search engine indexing,,,,,http://eprints.rclis.org/15227/ http://eprints.rclis.org/15227/1/kipp-2011-biomedicaltagging-kovol38.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-3-245,,10.5771/0943-7444-2011-3-245,1590506303,,0,002-852-458-537-866; 005-255-725-462-840; 006-061-426-560-599; 009-893-668-495-073; 011-981-882-161-607; 023-896-010-128-294; 036-706-153-054-917; 056-691-156-113-309; 063-174-909-674-61X; 066-915-178-556-066; 067-080-082-794-709; 067-865-739-836-871; 078-854-735-841-644; 080-249-519-797-470; 088-125-089-430-818; 088-478-983-368-784; 114-758-821-565-205; 124-055-238-548-83X; 132-384-476-148-433; 135-120-936-631-160; 152-613-117-717-093; 168-238-772-948-559; 168-466-197-336-584; 179-818-820-671-33X; 181-329-720-583-409; 182-872-147-730-736; 196-666-483-027-24X; 197-613-177-416-551,18

In this vein, it established the nominal concept or definiendum-archival knowledge-seeking to analyze its real definition, composed by three inseparable definiens: the concept of fonds, the knowledge of documentary form and the knowledge of document creation context.

Smiraglia,"Domain analysis helps visualize the semantic intellectual content of a coherent group, or domain. A domain is a group with an ontological base, an underlying teleology, common hypotheses and epistemology, and social semantics. FRBR has spawned a family of conceptual models, and much writing. A recent second anthology about the FRBR models raises the question of whether a coherent domain has formed around the FRBR family. Domain analysis is used here to visualize the semantic content of the FRBR family domain, and to compare its two main component groups, scholar authors and practitioner authors. Results show a common teleology with some subtle differences surrounding implementation of the FRBR family of models.",4,1,174,185,Conceptual model; Artificial intelligence; Domain analysis; Cognitive science; Ontology; Social semantics; Intellectual content; A domain; Computer science; Knowledge management; Teleology,,,,,http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/download/14658/12301 http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/view/14658,http://dx.doi.org/10.7152/nasko.v4i1.14658,,10.7152/nasko.v4i1.14658,2076048144,,0,007-488-766-021-822; 013-993-917-540-609; 102-347-100-976-096; 176-375-254-109-852; 190-614-225-751-822,1

The analysis indicates that different socially and historically embedded discourses on art, including pre-paradigmatic studies and scholarly paradigms, pervade knowledge organization in the art institution at three levels, respectively: 1. Art exhibitions, 2. Primary and tertiary document types (printed, audio-visual, and multimedia documents), and 3. Classification systems, bibliographies, and thesauri. The article presents three paradigms in art scholarship (iconographic, stylistic and materialistic) and analyzes in which way, and to what extent, these paradigms are integrated in the taxonomies of the LCC, DDC, UDC, and Soviet BBK classification systems. The paper also addresses the relationship among paradigms, principles for exhibiting works of art, ways of conceptualising and organizing the content in documents on art history, and LIS knowledge organization systems. It is concluded that the UDC, in particular, is well suited for representation of knowledge produced in the contexts of pre-paradigmatic, iconological, and stylistic studies. But documents by the so-called New art scholars drawing on interdisciplinary studies and representing new approaches and paradigms break with the taxonomies on art in the classical hierarchical, universal classification systems. A step towards a solution of problems caused by this break is a polyhierarchical thesaurus such as the Art & Architecture Thesaurus.",30,,128,143,Epistemology; Dewey Decimal Classification; Architecture; Sociology; Materialism; Scholarship; Knowledge organization; Exhibition; Linguistics; The arts; Art methodology,,,,,http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/2398318860,http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/2398318860,,,2415379110,,0,,30

The study analyzes the field of social work. It is aimed at developing a systematic, comprehensive, and scientifically valid knowledge map, and its applicability as an efficient tool to adequately represent knowledge in the field. The map is composed of seven parts: foundation (meta-knowledge), social worker, environment, organization, area of practice, method, and client. The study followed a qualitative four-phase research methodology. The first phase was a phenomenological analysis of the basic characteristics of social work as a social service. The analysis resulted in a seven-facet subject classification. In the second phase the conceptual skeleton was elaborated, and adjusted to the field of social work by a grounded-theory methodology. The data used for grounding the model were 14 social work resources. The model was tested in the third phase by classifying 200 terms randomly selected from the Dictionary of Social Work (Barker, 1999). Finally, in the fourth phase we classified 197 papers published in two leading journals, Social Work and Social Service Review, in three successive years, 1997, 1998, and 1999. This exemplary study has implications for domain analysis.

We briefly introduce the beginning and principles of folksonomy and discuss the categorizing concept of folksonomies on the basis of the computer program delicious. The selection of the metadata tagged is not accidental, rather tagging follows a pattern that proves to be the pattern for the classic power law, which, in many complex systems is seen to unfold as an imitation-dynamic that creates an asymmetry, where a few descriptive metadata are often reproduced and the majority seldom reproduced. In del.icio.us, it is the very broadband basic subject headings that are often reproduced and achieve power in the system - which in cognitive psychology is called cognitive basic categories - while the small, more specific subject headings are seldom reproduced. The law of power's underlying imitation-dynamic in del.icio.us is explained from the perspective of different theoretical paradigms, i.e. network, economy and cognition. The theorectical and speculative conclusion is that the law of power and asymmetry is biased by a cognitive economizing through a simplification principle in the users' construction of descriptive metadata. Free tagging in folksonomies is comparable to empirical experiments in free categorization. Users often choose broad basic categories, because that requires the least cognitive effort. The consequences are that folksonomy is not necessarily a better, more realistic and cheaper method of creating metadata than that which can be generated through taxonomies, faceted classification or search algorithms. Folksonomy as a self-organizing system likely cannot create better and cheaper descriptive metadata.",34,1,16,33,Data mining; Cognition; Information retrieval; Folksonomy; Faceted classification; Computer science; Markup language; Complex system; Social network; Metadata; Categorization,,,,,,,,,2473030389,,0,,25

The model of scale-free networks, which has been recently developed and widely applied since, can be effectively used in terminology research as well. Operation based on the principle of networks is a universal characteristic of complex systems. Networks are governed by general laws. The model of scale-free networks can be viewed as a statistical-probability model, and it can be described with mathematical tools. Its main feature is that ‘everything is connected to everything else’, that is every node is reachable (in a few steps) starting from any other node; this phenomena called ‘the small world phenomenon’. The existence of a linguistic network and the general laws of the operation of networks enable us to place issues of language use in the complex system of relations that reveal the deeper connections between phenomena with the help of networks embedded in each other. The realization of the metaphor that language also has a network structure is the basis of the classification methods of the terminological system, and likewise of the ways of creating terminology databases, which serve the purpose of providing easy and versatile accessibility to specialised knowledge.",40,6,422,431,Network theory; Artificial intelligence; Metaphor; Network structure; Classification methods; Computer science; Complex system; Phenomenon; Terminology; Knowledge management; Theoretical computer science,,,,,http://real.mtak.hu/27031/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2013-6-422,,10.5771/0943-7444-2013-6-422,1682641436,,0,,2

068-575-306-450-958,E. Wyndham Hulme's Classification of the Attributes of Books: On an Early Model of a Core Bibliographical Entity,,2017,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Thomas M. Dousa,"Modelling bibliographical entities is a prominent activity within knowledge organization today. Current models of bibliographic entities, such as Functional Requirements for Bibliographical Records (FRBR) and the Bibliographic Framework (BIBFRAME), take inspiration from data-modelling methods developed by computer scientists from the mid-1970s on. Thus, it would seem that the modelling of bibliographic entities is an activity of very recent vintage. However, it is possible to find examples of bibliographical models from earlier periods of knowledge organization. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to one such model, outlined by the early 20th-century British classification theorist E. Wyndham Hulme in his essay on “Principles of Book Classification” (1911–1912). There, Hulme set forth a classification of various attributes by which books can conceivably be classified. These he first divided into accidental and inseparable attributes. Accidental attributes were subdivided into edition-level and copy-level attributes and inseparable attitudes, into physical and non-physical attributes. Comparison of Hulme’s classification of attributes with those of FRBR and BIBFRAME 2.0 reveals that the different classes of attributes in Hulme’s classification correspond to groups of attributes associated with different bibliographical entities in those models. These later models assume the existence of different bibliographic entities in an abstraction hierarchy among which attributes are distributed, whereas Hulme posited only a single entity— the book—, whose various aspects he clustered into different classes of attributes. Thus, Hulme’s model offers an interesting alternative to current assumptions about how to conceptualize the relationship between attributes and entities in the bibliographical universe.",6,1,21,38,Data mining; Abstraction; BIBFRAME; Knowledge organization; Book Classification; Single entity; Hierarchy; Computer science,,,,,https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/view/15228/12686 https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/download/15228/12686,https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/view/15228/12686,,,2747743971,,0,,0

The history and origin of bibliographic classification [Dewey, Bliss, Mills, Beghtol] are discussed from the perspective of pragmatist philosophy and social studies of science [Kuhn, Merton, Reica]. Choices of structural principles in different schemes are found to rely on more or less implicit philosophical foundations, ranging from rationalism to pragmatism. It is further shown how the increasing application of faceted structures as basic structural principles in universal classification schemes [DDC, UDC] impose rationalistic principles and structures for knowledge organization which are not in alignment with the development of knowledge in the covered disciplines. Further evidence of rationalism in knowledge organization is the fiction/non-fiction distinction, excluding the important role of artistic resources for, in particular, humanistic research. Finally, for the analysis of appropriate bibliographic unit, it is argued that there is a need to shift towards a semiotic approach, founded on an understanding of intertextuality, rather than applying standard principles of hierarchical decomposition of documents. It is concluded that a change in classification research is needed, founded on a more historical and social understanding of knowledge.",26,3,131,139,Epistemology; Interdisciplinarity; Sociology; Social studies; Pragmatism; Rationalism; Library classification; Knowledge organization; Unit of analysis; Discipline,,,,,,,,,2473405485,,0,,34

And yet, a question still seems unanswered: how was its literature classified and retrieved? It is a subject that has been given surprisingly little attention by the field of library-and-information science―indeed, by scholarship in general. Furthermore, a certain way of thinking has influenced the few answers that have so far been attempted. It is as if the scholars of our era have tried to identify the modern, physical library in the Hellenistic library in Alexandria. But such an approach is biased in a basic way: It simply does not consider the impact of the cultural and intellectual context of the library. This article differs fundamentally, because I reject the notion that the library was like those of today. Accordingly, an entirely new way of understanding how the library actually worked, in terms of classification and retrieval processes is presented. The key element is to understand the library both as a physical structure and as a struc- ture in the memory of the Alexandrian scholars. In this article, these structures are put together so as to propose a new interpretation of the library.",41,1,3,13,Epistemology; Literature; Art; Scholarship; Enlightenment; Physical structure; Knowledge management,,,,,http://curis.ku.dk/ws/files/104407327/The_Memory_Library.pdf https://static-curis.ku.dk/portal/files/104407327/The_Memory_Library.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2014-1-3,,10.5771/0943-7444-2014-1-3,2183290885,,0,002-820-574-179-73X; 004-972-083-186-957; 006-500-533-574-330; 020-238-059-776-299; 025-413-251-395-071; 030-424-445-345-720; 033-101-362-579-68X; 042-320-081-756-789; 045-917-551-573-700; 046-315-765-804-760; 048-437-564-986-762; 052-397-833-671-322; 063-464-935-038-436; 069-290-939-320-456; 076-057-005-313-079; 082-115-928-374-603; 088-924-162-720-936; 108-709-579-503-189; 108-794-341-267-306; 127-101-384-115-251; 131-722-282-859-520; 146-758-735-201-73X; 155-339-721-093-520; 168-888-280-268-711; 172-437-872-975-139; 179-580-644-668-897; 189-475-900-956-088; 192-464-862-776-215,2

This paper describes how a multidisciplinary team attempted to integrate metadata structures from several different collections in the development of an environmental information system. The results of this qualitative study suggest that though designers and users from diverse backgrounds could conceptualize and articulate the potential new knowledge the merged system might reveal, the perceived informational value of different access points varied with disciplinary membership, and the compromises forced by this merged collection created barriers and missed opportunities for the creation of new knowledge. However, people with a variety of backgrounds were able to contribute to negotiations about metadata decisions, suggesting that this may be a key realm of translation between diverse individuals in future collaborative environments. Consequences for domain-specific knowledge organization, and for a translation and integration role for those in the field of information science, are discussed.",30,,182,190,Knowledge representation and reasoning; Information system; Domain knowledge; Vocabulary; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Knowledge management; Discipline; Metadata; Information science,,,,,https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/49413 https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/49413/1/gazan-KO03.pdf,https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/49413,,,2473154616,,0,,4

076-823-648-953-459,Towards a General Conception of Warrants: First Notes,,2019,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Mario Barité,"<p>The areas of knowledge are organized around the identification of their terms of reference and the relationships established between them. This is the rational basis of -among others- the methodology for the development of knowledge organization systems. The authority from which to select, evaluate or revise the terminology of these systems is established in relation to any of the twenty-one warrants (literary, cultural, etc.) that have been proposed and studied unequally and autonomously in the literature of the area. This paper intends to introduce initial notes and comments to advance towards an overall conception of the warrant notion. For this purpose, the expression “warrant” is studied as a word of the general language as well as a term of specialized languages. Then, the scope of application of the warrants is established. Next, each warrant is placed in one of the approaches proposed by Hjørland to categorize theories and methods (empiricism, rationalism, historicism and pragmatism). From the above, some lines of research problems are identified. A typological table that includes data on all the warrants established until now is proposed, and the first conclusions are drawn. </p>",46,8,647,655,Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-647,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-647,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-647,3005977159,,0,,0

077-954-762-700-03X,"Actors, Domains, and Constraints in the Design and Construction of Controlled Vocabularies",,2008,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Jens-Erik Mai,"ABSTRACT: Classification schemes, thesauri, taxonomies, and other controlled vocabularies play important roles in the or-ganization and retrieval of information in many different environments. While the design and construction of controlled vo-cabularies have been prescribed at the technical level in great detail over the past decades, the methodological level has been somewhat neglected. However, classification research has in recent years focused on developing approaches to the analysis of users, domains, and activities that could produce requirements for the design of controlled vocabularies. Researchers have of-ten argued that the design, construction, and use of controlled vocabularies need to be based on analyses and understandings of the contexts in which these controlled vocabularies function. While one would assume that the growing body of research on human information behavior might help guide the development of controlled vocabularies shed light on these contexts, unfor-tunately, much of the research in this area is descriptive in nature and of little use for systems design. This paper discusses these trends and outlines a holistic approach that demonstrates how the design of controlled vocabularies can be informed by inves-tigations of people’s interactions with information. This approach is based on the Cognitive Work Analysis framework and outlines several dimensions of human-information interactions. Application of this approach will result is a comprehensive un-derstanding of the contexts in which the controlled vocabulary will function and which can be used for the development of for the development of controlled vocabularies.",35,1,16,29,Controlled vocabulary; Data mining; Classification scheme; Cognitive work analysis; Information behavior; Knowledge organization; Systems design; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://jenserikmai.info/Papers/2008_CVDesign.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-1-16,,10.5771/0943-7444-2008-1-16,89398202,,0,002-469-218-702-269; 005-288-279-802-34X; 005-766-981-957-927; 022-114-540-021-94X; 028-138-506-770-052; 029-275-535-129-990; 032-928-209-758-445; 035-234-319-611-842; 035-263-247-754-424; 038-981-980-657-737; 042-947-575-406-294; 043-281-866-549-314; 044-788-042-840-810; 047-722-747-471-725; 048-780-301-089-363; 056-023-122-194-370; 057-338-048-083-471; 058-561-035-474-236; 060-142-663-052-283; 064-979-192-032-082; 075-970-159-737-492; 077-112-458-112-240; 078-304-746-038-64X; 079-790-902-905-032; 087-831-676-456-440; 092-443-662-293-245; 092-574-183-104-523; 103-709-846-156-125; 110-243-849-964-365; 110-352-421-546-560; 130-264-225-723-086; 140-563-581-743-828; 141-145-576-773-920; 148-137-662-153-570; 148-705-787-905-169; 161-752-846-263-489; 173-092-050-492-440; 173-436-477-348-620; 174-857-541-059-519; 182-864-646-837-95X; 185-841-695-900-406; 194-556-078-156-224; 195-790-238-445-343,20

Raghavan,"The scholarly community is increasingly employing the Web both for publication of scholarly output and for locating and accessing relevant scholarly literature. Organization of this vast body of digital information assumes significance in this context. The sheer volume of digital information to be handled makes traditional indexing and knowledge representation strategies ineffective and impractical. It is, therefore, worth exploring new approaches. An approach being discussed considers the intrinsic semantics of texts of documents. Based on the hypothesis that noun phrases in a text are semantically rich in terms of their ability to represent the subject content of the document, this approach seeks to identify and extract noun phrases instead of single keywords, and use them as descriptors. This paper presents a methodology that has been developed for extracting noun phrases from Portuguese texts. The results of an experiment carried out to test the adequacy of the methodology are also presented.",33,1,45,56,Regular expression; Data mining; Semantics; Noun phrase; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Information access; Automatic indexing; Portuguese; Computer science; Search engine indexing,,,,,,,,,32010427,,0,056-389-892-407-420; 105-161-600-264-005; 142-683-183-818-491; 151-250-870-818-04X; 177-175-750-040-989,3

The largest group of indexed concepts in both databases was the category of entities while concepts belonging to the category of properties were almost missing in both databases. The second largest group of indexed concepts in KINF was the category of activities and in LISA the category of dimensions. Although the concept consistency between KINF and LISA remained rather low and was only 34 %, there were approximately 2.2 concepts per document which were indexed from the same documents in both databases.

The most recent edition of DDC, with its enhanced features, has greater potential than other traditional approaches. A review of selected Web sites that use DDC to organize Web resources indicates, however, that the full potential of the DDC scheme for this purpose has not been realized. While the review found that the DDC classification structure was more effective when compared with other knowledge organization systems, we conclude that DDC needs to be further enhanced to make it more suitable for this application. As widely reported in the professional literature, OCLC has conducted research on the potential of DDC for organizing Web resources.

The need for such bilingual microglossaries on subsections of a subject field for LSP teaching and translation purposes is emphasized in the Introduction. The concept""learner's glossary' is delimited among other types of terminological collections such as a specialised dictionary, a thesaurus and a term bank in Section 2 where the information categories in an entry are specified (keyterm plus translation equivalent(s), definition of keyterm and exemplary context, narrower terms with synonyms, definitions and translation equivalents; special phrases based on keyterm collocations with translation equivalents and exemplary contexts). Section 3 describes the principles and working methods of modern terminography as well as the source materials available for the glossary compilation. A hybrid term extraction technique is also described in that section and is used to extract the candidate terms with subsequent manual initial processing of the results. In Section 4 the theoretical grounds and methodology for analysing the conceptual relations in a terminological system are presented including the expert validation of the automatically extracted terms as a first phase in that process. Rationale for applying a lexico-semantic analysis in identifying collocational information on the keyterms is provided in Section 5 which is proposed to involve descriptions of the actantial structure of a keyterm for identifying verbal (T+v) collocations and of the paradigmatic and syntagmatic morpho-syntactic relations applicable to a keyterm.

Neelameghan,"This paper describes a proposal for a new approach to thesaurus design and construction that could have significant implications for change in the way multilingual thesauri are handled and integrated with each other. The formula presented here has its origin in the work of the German Thesaurus Committee and has had input from a number of scientists and practitioners in the field. The emphasis is on the various types of relationships found among concepts, notions and universals in languages. These relationships are analysed and refined beyond the approach taken in existing thesauri. This proposal is very much at the discussion stage and the author invites the assistance of interested readers through criticisms, discussion and dialogue. Applications of the proposed thesaurus are included and the major goal of this proposal is to provide the basis for improved design and integration of multilingual thesauri.",26,2,74,79,World Wide Web; Sociology; German; Problem of universals; Linguistics; Spirituality; Multiculturalism,,,,,,,,,2465332389,,0,,3

However, the boundaries with other categories of academic publishing are partly blurred. Data papers are (can be) generated automatically and are potentially machine-readable. Data papers are essentially information, i.e. description of data, but also partly contribute to the generation of knowledge and data on its own.

This objective concerns his information need. In order to achieve this objective, the user generally does some activities using the IRS. The IRS propose to the user with solutions in response to the queries formulated by the user. The main task of an IRS is to provide the user with solutions that are relevant to his information need. This is termed personalization of information. The main axe of our study is the how to personnalize the system's response according to the user's objective. We propose the use of a user model for personnailizing the system's response. In our approach, the user model defines what to represent for each user. The activities of the user during the use of an IRS is recorded based on the user model. The analysis and synthesis of these activities are used to provide the user with more relevant solutions according to his objective. Three different applications have been developed to validate our approach of personalizing the system?s response and based on an architecture that we defined for a cooperative information retrieval. The three applications are METIORE_STREEMS, METIORE_LORIA and METIORE_REVUES. METIORE_STREEMS is an IRS for managing multimedia information on trees authorized for reforestation by the European Union (EU). The project was sponsored under the EU project LEONARDO. The second application, METIORE_LORIA is used for managing the publications of the computer science laboratory research center, LORIA, Nancy France. The third application METIORE_REVUES is used for the access and analysis of a collection of a journal called Relations Publiques Informations.",27,,17,26,Architecture; Data mining; Artificial intelligence; Information system; Personalization; Information retrieval; European union; Multimedia information; Laboratory research; Computer science; User modeling; Information needs,,,,,https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00099270,https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00099270,,,215024682,,0,,2

089-926-127-972-615,Semantics in the Semantic Web: A Critical Evaluation †,,2011,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Maurício Barcellos Almeida; Renato Rocha Souza; Fred Fonseca,"In recent years, the term “semantics” has been widely used in various fields of research and particularly in areas related to information technology. One of the motivators of such an appropriation is the vision of the Semantic Web, a set of developments underway, which might allow one to obtain better results when querying on the web. However, it is worth asking what kind of semantics we can find in the Semantic Web, considering that studying the subject is a complex and controversial endeavour. Working within this context, we present an account of semantics relying on the main linguist approaches, in order to then analyze what semantics is within the scope of information technology. We critically evaluate a spectrum, which proposes the ordination of instruments (models, languages, taxonomic structures, to mention but a few) according to a semantic scale. In addition to proposing a new extended spectrum, the article suggests alternative interpretations with the aim of clarifying the use of the term “semantics” in different contexts. Finally, we offer our conclusions regarding the semantic in the Semantic Web and mention future directions and complementary works.",38,3,187,203,Semantic integration; Data mining; Semantic analytics; Semantic search; Semantic Web Stack; Semantic Web; Information retrieval; Computer science; Semantic computing; Social Semantic Web; Semantic Web Rule Language,,,,,http://mba.eci.ufmg.br/downloads/SemanticsSemWebko_38_2011.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-3-187,,10.5771/0943-7444-2011-3-187,2333248141,,0,004-502-436-166-438; 006-469-811-332-671; 012-710-140-008-998; 013-081-786-072-873; 013-984-697-364-054; 017-429-218-986-407; 021-736-440-602-931; 022-718-716-374-077; 029-922-310-274-896; 031-005-158-506-288; 038-769-999-176-206; 060-769-725-405-021; 068-930-003-699-346; 082-151-985-050-371; 088-516-454-211-575; 091-181-721-039-607; 092-728-395-461-388; 095-469-031-905-553; 095-686-223-024-567; 097-548-000-901-224; 101-967-517-926-853; 106-464-848-086-69X; 112-007-111-549-307; 115-120-484-431-356; 122-812-511-995-693; 126-584-690-684-180; 130-935-381-245-658; 141-300-306-847-309; 157-778-888-473-573; 161-245-172-210-615; 161-271-744-129-759; 161-752-846-263-489; 172-139-950-828-260; 172-680-785-491-136; 174-416-939-791-132; 180-118-751-642-014,14

In this paper we outline why this is the case, in particular focusing on the semantic gap between content and concept based multimedia retrieval. We survey some indexing vocabularies used for multimedia retrieval, and argue that techniques such as thesauri will be needed for the foreseeable future in order to support users in their need for multimedia content. In particular we argue that Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) techniques are not mature enough to solve the problem of indexing multimedia conceptually, and will not be able to replace human indexers for the foreseeable future.",43,3,180,183,Information retrieval; Multimedia information retrieval; Knowledge organisation; Computer science; Knowledge management; Search engine indexing; Semantic gap,,,,,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/16057/ https://core.ac.uk/display/96581680,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2016-3-180,,10.5771/0943-7444-2016-3-180,2758471965,,0,,2

Each criterion of OnE has been defined in a way such that together they are capable of evaluating any ontology from all aspects. The process of using OnE for evaluation has been demonstrated by evaluating chemical ontologies. Also, for this purpose, an ontology on the domain of agricultural chemicals has been constructed by following the human-centric faceted approach for ontology construction (HCFOC) and has been evaluated using OnE. The results obtained after the evaluation has provided insights about the ontologies. The constructed ontology aims to support any information system trying to support farmers in the process of decision making while selecting chemicals for use in agriculture. Also, it is envisaged that the demonstrated ontology and the set of evaluation criteria named OnE will redefine ontology evaluation and make it easy while making a strong impact on ontology developers. </p>",47,4,283,299,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-4-283,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-4-283,,,0,,0

Burger,"Thomas Kuhn differentiated normal scientific progression from the replacement of basic assumptions by a novel paradigm. With his recent death, it is time to sequence the innovation cycle, some of whose parts he had detailed. A Kuhnian discovery faces battle before it is can even be tried and evaluated. We enumerate over two dozen way-stations, or phases, many heretofore vaguely differentiated in half a dozen academic disciplines. Each phase is illustrated with a vignette. Within that cycle, the mental awareness that one has found an anomaly is a distinct advantage, for which we propose the name of neocognition. Certain phases are especially vulnerable dead ends, choke-points, of the entire sequence. Particularly so are the 8 th to 10 th periods - the cultural reactions based on the perceived immediacy of benefit. Any requirement to obtain commercial support at this pre-development stage prevents the emergence of even farsighted latent support that could hurdle the remaining steps. The eventual acceptance of any Kuhnism activates forces that will likely evolve its own era of scientific / political correctness. - From a score of thumbnail histories, it becomes obvious that research organizations may accelerate basic discovery by pre-constituency dissemination",24,2,92,103,Epistemology; Dozen; Battle; Immediacy; Political correctness; Computer science; Discipline; Vignette,,,,,,,,,2531263056,,0,,0

Davies,"The paper will look into different patterns of facet analysis used in the UDC schedules and how these affect the scheme presentation, the underlying data structure and the management of the classification scheme. From the very beginning, UDC was designed to represent the universe of knowledge as an integral whole allowing for subjects/concepts from all fields of knowledge to be combined, linked and the nature of their relationships made explicit. In Otlet's original design, the emphasis for his new type of classification was on the coordination of classmarks at the point of searching, i.e., post-coordination, which he firmly rooted in an expressive notational system. While some UDC classes exhibit various patterns of facet analytical theory proper, others, although used in an analytico-synthetic fashion, follow less canonical structural patterns. The authors highlight the lack of connection made throughout the various stages of UDC restructuring between: a) theoretical requirements of an overarching facet analytical theory as a founding principle guiding the construction of schedules; and, b) practical requirements for an analytico-synthetic classification in terms of notational presentation and data structure that enables its use in indexing and retrieval, as well as its management online.",44,6,425,435,Data mining; Classification scheme; Data structure; Information retrieval; Formality; Faceted classification; Facet (geometry); Computer science; Restructuring; Schedule; Search engine indexing,,,,,https://rgu-repository.worktribe.com/output/247168 https://core.ac.uk/display/155779211,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2017-6-425,,10.5771/0943-7444-2017-6-425,2778295795,,0,,0

In other words, the ""core"" concept and ""anchored"" concept are mutually supportive of one another. These two concepts can be linked with other concepts to produce more extended and robust knowledge structures in memory. This study used a flow map method to identify learner's ""core"" and ""anchored"" concepts derived from the treatment instruction about thermal physics. The results showed that with the assistance of ""core"" concept, profitably mediated by the ""anchored"" concept, learners could recall more extended knowledge, with greater richness and with higher connection than in the absence of this organizing information (Experiment 1). However, the difference between the provision of a group core concept and an individual core concept did not reach any significance level in the recall task two-month later (Experiment 2). When the recall task was carried out six months later, the group ""anchored"" concept showed the essential assistance to the recall of knowledge (Experiment 3). This study has provided potential insights not only about the functional mechanisms of learners' knowledge construction but also for classification research.",32,4,143,158,Recall; Cognition; Cognitive science; Thermal physics; Flow map; Memoria; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Concept learning; Knowledge management; Social psychology,,,,,https://ir.nctu.edu.tw:443/handle/11536/14415,https://ir.nctu.edu.tw:443/handle/11536/14415,,,841483182,,0,,4

The investigation of the systems in use also presented the opportunity to gather business concepts that were used to construct a generic classification scheme for the purpose of information organization in small enterprises. Data were gathered from 24 small businesses located in three different provinces by means of personal interviews with owners/managers, guided by a questionnaire, and through on-site observation of the information organization systems used. The results of the survey show what information is regarded as critically important in small businesses, and give insight into the current situation with regard to information organization in the businesses.

Beghtol,"Bibliographic classification systems purport to organize the world of knowledge for information storage and retrieval purposes in libraries and bibliographies, both manual and online. The major systems that have predominated during the twentieth century were originally predicated on the academic disciplines. This structural principle is no longer adequate because multidisciplinary knowledge production has overtaken more traditional disciplinary perspectives and produced communities of cooperation whose documents cannot be accommodated in a disciplinary structure. This paper addresses the problems the major classifications face, reports some attempts to revise these systems to accommodate multidisciplinary works more appropriately, and describes some theoretical research perspectives that attempt to reorient classification research toward the pluralistic needs of multidisciplinary knowledge creation and the perspectives of different discourse communities. Traditionally, the primary desiderata of classification systems were mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity. The need to respond to multidisciplinary research may mean that hospitality will replace mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity as the most needed and useful characteristics of classification systems in both theory and practice.",25,,1,12,Hospitality; Data mining; Discourse community; Sociology; Library classification; Multidisciplinary approach; Information storage; Theoretical research; Knowledge production; Knowledge management; Discipline,,,,,,,,,2481146659,,0,,44

In this paper, the usability evaluation of several representative ontology editors is described. This evaluation is carried out by combining a heuristic pre-assessment with a subsequent user-testing phase. The target population is comprised of people with no specific ontology-creation skills that have a general knowledge about domain modelling.

Veltman,"Recent advances in technology assume a separation of content and presentation with respect to data structures. In terms of access, however, there are important reasons for relating content and presentation (different views, perspectives). The paper outlines some fundamental concepts underlying a prototype for a System for Universal Media Searching (SUMS), namely, learning filters, and knowledge contexts, levels of knowledge, questions as strategy: purpose as orientation; media choices, quality, quantity, questions, space using maps and projections; multi-temporal views and integrating tools. It foresees how such a system, linked with the equivalent of a digital reference room, will provide the basis for a System for Universal Multimedia Access (SUMMA). The latter part of the paper addresses recent developments in three-dimensional interfaces. It claims that these are particularly suited for certain tasks such as visualising connections in conceptual spaces; seeing invisible differences as well as comprehension and prediction by seeing absence. It suggests also some ways in which two- and three-dimensional interfaces can be used in complementary ways.

Riggs,"Parts I to III of this series have examined the terminology of Terminology by contrast with the vocabulary of Onomantics and identified some of the differences and difficulties revealed by a close study of ISO-1087, the most important glossary for terminologists. Part IV, finally, offers a speculative explanation of these problems. My central hypothesis is that an aversion to neologisms - especially newly coined words - impedes the introduction and acceptance of new concepts. The pressure for standardization of terminology compounds this difficulty. There are three kinds of neologisms: 1. newly coined words (neoterisms), 2. phases composed of familiar words (phrasal tags) and 3. familiar words for which new meanings have been stipulated (meta-terms). Neologisms in the form of phrases containing familiar words are often found in ISO 1087. Some perplexing ambiguities in ISO 1087 occur when new meanings are stipulated for familiar words, creating terminological metaphors (meta-terms) that are often obscure. Such meta-terms abound in the terminology of Terminology. Increased willingness to accept well-formed new words (neoterisms) would greatly simplify the development of a more adequate terminology for Terminology. The use of pleonasms is recommended as a technique to overcome ambiguity by linking familiar words having new meanings (meta-terms) to new words for the same concepts (neoterisms) and as a simple way to facilitate the introduction of such neoterisms.",24,1,8,17,Epistemology; Standardization; Willingness to accept; Vocabulary; Glossary; Ambiguity; Computer science; Linguistics; Terminology; Neologism,,,,,http://jglobal.jst.go.jp/public/20090422/200902163911370652,http://jglobal.jst.go.jp/public/20090422/200902163911370652,,,2502259138,,0,,0

Fugmann,"The comparative evaluation of different mechanized information systems continues to constitute a controversial topic in the literature. Diametrically different opinions, seemingly corroborated through empirical evidence, have been presented since the time of the Cranfield experiments. Similar situations have often been encountered in the history of science if reasoning has exclusively been based on empiricism. In the information scientific field, several empirical laws have been formulated, for example that of the alledgedly inverse precision-recall relationship in information retrieval, of the assumed direct relationship between consistency and quality of indexing, and of the alledged equivalence of automatic with intellectual indexing. Empiricism is seen as only another variation of positivism, which has been abandoned in the natural sciences since the middle of this century for its evident inadequacy, but has latently survived in information science and even now dominates here. Here, it constitutes a source of continual confusion and an impediment to progress. For literally anything an empirical proof can be submitted provided that suitable examples are selected and methods are chosen. Substantial advance in Library and Information Science requires abandoning empiricism. Budd's hermeneutic phenomenology seems to constitute a promising substitute (1995).",26,1,3,9,Epistemology; Positivism; Sociology; Empirical evidence; Equivalence (measure theory); Information system; Empiricism; Search engine indexing; History of science; Information science,,,,,,,,,2522975102,,0,,5

In the preliminary results, we have defined instance-based and schema-based categories of semantic enrichment. In the instance-based category, in which enrichment occurs by enhancing the content of entities, we further determined three types, including: 1) enriching the entities by linking to diverse external resources in order to provide additional data of multiple perspectives; 2) enriching the entities with missing data, which is needed to satisfy the semantic queries; and, 3) providing the entities with access to an extended knowledge base. In the schema-based categories that enrichment occurs by enhancing the relations between the properties, we have identified two types, including: 1) enriching the properties by defining the hierarchical relations between properties; and, 2) specifying properties’ domain and range for data reasoning. In addition, the study implements the LOD dataset in a digital humanities platform to demonstrate how instances and entities can be applied in the full texts where the relationship between entities are highlighted in order to bring scholars more semantic details of the texts. </p>",46,8,607,614,History of China; Public administration; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-607,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-607,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-607,2964691822,,0,,0

Tennis,"A starting point for contributing to the greater good is to examine and interrogate existing knowledge organization practices that do harm, whether that harm is intentional or accidental, or an inherent and unavoidable evil. As part of the transition movement, the authors propose to inventory the manifestations and implications of the production of suffering by knowledge organization systems through constructing a taxonomy of harm. Theoretical underpinnings guide ontological commitment, as well as the recognition of the problem of harm in knowledge organization systems. The taxonomy of harm will be organized around three main questions: what happens?, who participates?, and who is affected and how? The aim is to heighten awareness of the violence that classifications and naming practices carry, to unearth some of the social conditions and motivations that contribute to and are reinforced by knowledge organization systems, and to advocate for intentional and ethical knowledge organization practices to achieve a minimal level of harm.",40,4,266,272,Accidental; Body of knowledge; Ontology; Harm; Knowledge organization; Ontological commitment; Social condition; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,https://digital.lib.washington.edu:443/researchworks/handle/1773/37933 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2880948,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2013-4-266,,10.5771/0943-7444-2013-4-266,2614799192,,0,031-201-164-261-158; 071-022-924-688-582; 085-647-811-229-070; 086-321-596-957-783; 148-571-180-308-199,4

105-100-051-441-427,Sexual Boundaries and Subcultural Discipline,,2012,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Patrick Keilty,"The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate that the mechanisms of power around classifications of gender and sexuality are not always top-down or bottom-up. Instead, the weight of social discipline among members of sexual subcultures themselves helps to create these classifications, often reflecting the nomenclature of subjects and desires within sexual subcultures in a complex relationship to a dominant culture. Critically examining two benchmarks in the development of sexual nomenclature within queer subcultures, this paper finds its evidence in George Chauncey's little known analysis (1985) of a navy investigation of male homosexuality at the Newport Naval Training Station during the World War I era and in contemporary folksonomic classifi- cations of representations of queer desire within Xtube, a database of online pornography. Social discipline within these sexual sub- cultures occurs in the stabilization of nomenclature through socialization and through members' overt intervention into each oth- ers' self-understanding. Both the Newport and Xtube evidence also reveals a complex social and cultural structure among members of sexual subcultures by drawing our attention to the particularity of various modes of sexual being and the relationship between those modes and particular configurations of sexual identity. In the process, this paper allows us to reassess, first, a presupposition of folksonomies as free of discipline allowing for their emancipatory potential and, second, the prevailing binary understandings of authority in the development of sexual nomenclatures and classifications as either top-down or bottom-up.",36,6,417,431,Gender studies; Sociology; Presupposition; Socialization; Sexual identity; Navy; Queer; Pornography; Human sexuality; Dominant culture; Social psychology,,,,,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/78146/1/ko_39_2012_6_c.pdf https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/78146,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/78146,,,2116286503,,0,003-543-027-674-540; 012-652-438-359-587; 012-997-013-982-684; 017-231-206-046-780; 020-497-731-997-222; 028-064-043-010-663; 029-018-635-018-764; 035-809-334-410-365; 039-946-623-797-988; 043-495-913-746-69X; 044-094-604-229-17X; 055-317-271-594-826; 059-438-671-773-803; 064-670-699-508-566; 067-077-693-787-391; 074-220-138-428-181; 078-324-660-989-821; 078-372-125-528-210; 080-277-760-596-761; 081-044-097-710-132; 110-173-824-427-415; 118-215-443-692-382; 122-378-335-175-207; 123-669-744-776-683; 124-031-328-311-864; 124-216-270-017-531; 125-201-394-353-646; 129-250-747-093-04X; 132-412-668-018-006; 136-172-309-935-502; 144-088-996-132-047; 144-859-975-068-210; 145-186-967-934-281; 148-571-180-308-199; 149-986-647-078-739; 156-956-008-475-072; 161-577-664-521-752; 168-299-024-272-257; 174-812-603-865-761,6

By identifying sense components, by specifying sense elements which differentiate closely related verbs, and by studying sense variations, we found new criteria permitting the constitution of verbs semantic classes so as to better structure the lexicon and to better organize semantic descriptions. In this paper, we first represent the verb semantics by means of the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS), adding if necessary, new primitives and new semantic fields. We then study sense variations with the aim of making semantic description more accurate, comprehensive and flexible",25,3,104,109,Feeling; Semantics; Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Semantic field; Verb; Lexicon; Lexical conceptual structure; Verb semantics; Computer science; Linguistics; Modal verb,,,,,,,,,2474524659,,0,,0

The question is analyzed to what extent this approach can be useful for multilingual thesauri, in particular regarding the functionality the thesaurus is designed to fulfil. Both the runtime use, and the construction and maintenance ofthe system is taken into consideration. Using the perspective of general language technology enables to draw on experience from a broader range of fields beyond thesaurus design itself as well as to consider the possibility of using a thesaurus as a knowledge module in various systems which process natural language. Therefore the features which thesauri and other natural-language processing systems have in common are emphasized, especially at the level of systems design and their core functionality.

Smiraglia,"Works are key entities in the universe of recorded knowledge. Works are those deliberate creations (known variously as opera, oeuvres, Werke, etc.) that constitute individual sets of created conceptions that stand as the formal records of knowledge. In the information retrieval domain, the work as opposed to the document, has only recently received focused attention. In this paper, the definition of the work as an entity for information retrieval is examined. A taxonomic definition (that is, a definition built around a taxonomy) is presented. An epistemological perspective aids in understanding the components of the taxonomic definition. Works, thus defined as entities for information retrieval, are seen to constitute sets of varying instantiations of abstract creations. These variant instantiations must be explicitly identified in future systems for documentary information retrieval. An expanded perception of works, such as that presented in this paper, helps us understand the variety of ways in which mechanisms for their control and retrieval might better be shaped in future.",28,4,192,202,Epistemology; Document retrieval; Perception; Knowledge organization; Computer science,,,,,,,,,2337040715,,0,,18

It is information science’s role to be vigilant in perpetuating seditious discourses which end up reaffirming offenses, prejudices and humiliations to certain groups of people, especially those labeled as marginalized, that is, who are not part of the dominant group holding social power. In the quest for this diversity, this study reviews the literature of the area on how thesauri can become more inclusive and on the role of semantic warrant, specific to the philosophical, literary and cultural warrant. This research highlights the need to review thesaurus construction models so that they can be more open and inclusive to the cultural diversity of today’s society, formed by social actors who claim their spaces and representations. To this end, guidelines are suggested for the construction of thesauri procedures that allow cultural warrant receptivity. </p>",46,8,639,646,Cultural diversity; Knowledge organization; Social perspective; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-639,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-639,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-639,3005603996,,0,,0

It discusses these issues from the point of view of the AAT and considers how its structure and content serve as a bridging mechanism between the many different manifestations of the visual arts and the different types of organizations serving the viewers of art, whether as students, scholars, collections managers, or the enjoying public. This paper shows how a knowledge base like the AAT helps this variety of users develop approaches to the visual arts and suggests that the special nature of dealing with image rather than text influences how the thesaurus is structured and applied",20,1,30,34,Architecture; World Wide Web; Visual arts; Content analysis; Bridging (networking); Cultural object; Computer science; Knowledge base; Multimedia,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1993-1-30 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=4925074,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1993-1-30,,10.5771/0943-7444-1993-1-30,2467215344,,0,,9

116-584-634-731-701,The best of both worlds: highlighting the synergies of combining manual and automatic knowledge organization methods to improve information search and discovery.,2015-09-30,2015,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Paul Hugh Cleverley; Simon M. Burnett,"Research suggests organizations across all sectors waste a significant amount of time looking for information and often fail to leverage the information they have. In response, many organizations have deployed some form of enterprise search to improve the ˜findability of information. Debates persist as to whether thesauri and manual indexing or automated machine learning techniques should be used to enhance discovery of information. In addition, the extent to which a Knowledge Organization System (KOS) enhances discoveries or indeed blinds us to new ones remains a moot point. The oil and gas industry is used as a case study using a representative organization. Drawing on prior research, a theoretical model is presented which aims to overcome the shortcomings of each approach. This synergistic model could help re-conceptualize the ˜manual versus ˜automatic debate in many enterprises, accommodating a broader range of information needs. This may enable enterprises to develop more effective information and knowledge management strategies and ease the tension between what is often perceived as mutually exclusive competing approaches. Certain aspects of the theoretical model may be transferable to other industries which is an area for further research.

Schreinemakers,"In recent years management and business studies have witnessed the emergence of a new field of activity, named corporate knowledge management (CKM). The primary goal of this management discipline is to enhance and improve the use of knowledge as a corporate resource in organizations. Theoretical and practical initiatives in this area of management, however, have met with some difficulty regarding the conception of knowledge that should guide these efforts. This paper critically examines the contribution of Nonaka (1994) to this conceptual problem. While we support Nonaka's reasons for choosing a subjectivist epistemology in this managerial context, we argue that he is seriously misguided with regard to the philosophical and managerial ramifications of his choice. Consequently, we doubt whether Nonaka's views can serve as a successful paradigm for corporate knowledge management.",24,1,24,32,Sociology; Knowledge economy; Personal knowledge management; Relativistic theory; Subjectivism; Business studies; Knowledge management,,,,,,,,,2510250737,,0,,31

In knowledge organization (KO), a number of basic questions remain to be addressed in the 21st cen- tury. Ten of them are identified and synthetically discussed: (1) Can KO principles be extended to a broader scope, including hypertexts, multimedia, museum objects, and monuments? (2) Can the two basic approaches, ontological and epistemological, be reconciled? (3) Can any ontological foundation of KO be identified? (4) Should disciplines continue to be the structural base of KO? (5) How can viewpoint warrant be respected? (6) How can KO be adapted to local collection needs? (7) How can KO deal with changes in knowledge? (8) How can KO systems represent all the dimensions listed above? (9) How can software and formats be improved to better serve these needs? (10) Who should do KO: information professionals, authors or readers?",35,2-3,137,149,Epistemology; Sociology; Ontology; Warrant; Information policy; Knowledge organization; Research questions; Scientific method,,,,,http://mate.unipv.it/gnoli/gnoli2008b.pdf https://www-dimat.unipv.it/gnoli/gnoli2008b.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-137,,10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-137,2182203409,,0,004-292-606-497-684; 004-572-952-628-786; 005-381-168-447-96X; 010-462-179-770-979; 029-276-315-904-363; 029-359-373-093-910; 030-052-392-380-99X; 038-249-176-007-541; 039-489-547-552-469; 042-002-086-935-037; 046-308-014-520-294; 046-846-411-960-590; 048-841-863-051-646; 050-492-747-870-926; 056-709-260-660-68X; 059-438-671-773-803; 061-457-500-627-09X; 062-493-798-375-845; 063-846-135-421-940; 073-624-191-942-344; 074-697-929-068-168; 075-177-709-684-193; 075-644-245-913-102; 076-326-065-134-294; 078-789-311-688-035; 079-101-643-158-485; 081-806-769-863-288; 082-942-834-587-594; 083-832-868-153-97X; 087-831-676-456-440; 092-736-012-017-002; 098-507-725-113-618; 099-817-334-957-565; 112-178-500-251-383; 116-383-629-105-174; 122-667-315-891-776; 133-688-136-209-833; 142-255-262-450-284; 153-017-318-509-51X; 161-265-405-929-03X; 167-637-408-313-137; 167-907-793-539-200; 171-708-200-297-211; 176-535-893-212-063,20

Its findings can be relevant to knowledge organization, and models of knowledge can, in turn, offer relevant ontological suggestions. Several philosophers in time have pointed out that reality is structured into a series of integrative levels, like the physical, the biological, the mental, and the cultural, and that each level plays as a base for the emergence of more complex levels. More detailed theories of levels have been developed by Nicolai Hartmann and James K. Feibleman, and these have been considered as a source for structuring principles in bibliographic classification by both the Classification Research Group (CRG) and Ingetraut Dahlberg. CRG's analysis of levels and of their possible application to a new general classification scheme based on phenomena instead of disciplines, as it was formulated by Derek Austin in 1969, is examined in detail. Both benefits and open problems in applying integrative levels to bibliographic classification are pointed out.",31,3,151,160,Epistemology; Classification scheme; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Library classification; Data science; Ontology; Structuring; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,https://philpapers.org/rec/GNOLOR http://www-dimat.unipv.it/~gnoli/gnoli&poli2004.pdf https://www-dimat.unipv.it/gnoli/gnoli%26poli2004.pdf,https://philpapers.org/rec/GNOLOR,,,28549334,,0,000-927-783-697-821; 004-292-606-497-684; 004-572-952-628-786; 005-381-168-447-96X; 006-083-882-713-015; 008-352-304-691-067; 009-250-243-917-382; 012-582-492-657-269; 014-807-313-107-542; 015-143-726-833-566; 016-822-232-415-322; 018-513-292-822-628; 029-276-315-904-363; 038-249-176-007-541; 043-919-177-776-837; 048-059-821-451-22X; 068-842-015-943-027; 074-789-537-603-270; 078-370-387-091-320; 084-230-607-359-185; 086-267-164-845-070; 097-921-728-549-473; 098-507-725-113-618; 100-079-513-299-504; 102-555-702-781-751; 117-593-887-007-43X; 125-548-650-010-750; 135-525-987-587-003; 136-812-479-151-914; 159-061-020-740-731; 172-999-582-258-136; 198-116-724-393-416,38

Pt. 1: Their contributions to Knowledge Organization,,1996,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Fred W. Riggs,"Lexicography is the science that undergirds the preparation of dictionaries as lists of words and phrases whose meanings are defined on the basis of semantic analysis. By contrast, Onomantics reverses this paradigm : it identifies concepts that are related to each other and need to be represented as important tools in the production and organization of knowledge. Terminology bridges these two approaches : it draws heavily on the lexicographic model while moving stolidly toward an onomantic framework - from a semantic focus on the meanings of words to an onomasiological concern with the identification and representation of concepts. The article is the first of a Two Part sequence in which the basic concepts and the rationale of Onomantics are identified. They provide a framework for enhancing the ability of Terminology to contribute to Knowledge Organization. The essential logic of Onomantics as the science of concept representation is explained and its general relationship to Terminology as a growing but mixed field of applications is discussed.

The study was conducted in two stages: i) literature identification, where the systematic literature review methodology was employed; and, ii) ontological review, where the parametric approach was applied. The study resulted in a set of fourteen papers discussing the flood ontology (FO). The ontological review revealed that most of the flood ontologies were task ontologies, formal, modular, and used web ontology language (OWL) for their representation. The most (re)used ontologies were SWEET, SSN, Time, and Space. METHONTOLOGY was the preferred design methodology, and for evaluation, application-based or data-based approaches were preferred. The majority of the ontologies were built around the response phase of the disaster. The unavailability of the full ontologies somewhat restricted the current study as the structural ontology metrics are missing. But the scientific community, the developers, of flood disaster management systems can refer to this work for their research to see what is available in the literature on flood ontology and the other major domains essential in building the FO. </p>",47,2,138,159,Parametric statistics; Data mining; Ontology (information science); Computer science; Flood myth,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-138,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-138,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-138,3015240837,,0,,0

This holds true in particular in the case of general concepts and of their syntactical connectivity. Hence, natural language query phrasing and searching is an unending adventure of trial and error and, in most cases, has an unsatisfactory outcome with respect to the recall and precision ratios of the responses. Human indexing is based on knowledgeable document interpretation and aims - among other things - at introducing predictability into the representation of documents. Due to the indeterminacy of natural language text phrasing and image construction, any adequate indexing is also indeterminate in nature and therefore inherently defies any satisfactory algorithmization. But human indexing suffers from a different set of deficiencies which are absent in the processing of non-interpreted natural language. An optimally effective information system combines both types of language in such a manner that their specific strengths are preserved and their weaknesses are avoided. If the goal is a large and enduring information system for more than merely known-item searches, the expenditure for an advanced index language and its knowledgeable and careful employment is unavoidable.",29,,217,230,Language identification; Artificial intelligence; Natural language user interface; Information system; Natural language; Complementarity (molecular biology); Natural language processing; Trial and error; Computer science; Knowledge management; Search engine indexing; Precision and recall,,,,,,,,,2465054596,,0,,3

Marijuán; Raquel Moral; and Jorge Navarro,"In one of the most important conceptual changes of our times, biology has definitely abandoned its mechanistic hardcore and is advancing ""fast and furious"" along the informational dimension. Biology has really become an information science; and, as such, it is also inspiring new ways of thinking and new kinds of knowledge paradigms beyond those discussed during past decades. In this regard, a new ""bioinformational"" approach to the inter-multi-disciplinary relationships among the sciences will be proposed herein: scientomics. Biologically inspired, scientomics contemplates the multifarious interactions between scientific disciplines from the ""knowledge recombination"" vantage point. In their historical expansion, the sciences would have recapitulated upon collective cognitive dynamics already realized along the evolutionary expansion of living systems, mostly by means of domain recombination processes within cellular genomes, but also occurring neurally inside the ""cerebral workspace"" of human brains and advanced mammals. Scientomics, understood as a new research field in the domain of knowledge organization, would capture the ongoing processes of scientific expansion and recombination by means of genomic inspired software (like in the new field of culturomics). It would explain the peculiar interaction maps of the sciences (scientometrics) as well as the increasing complexity of research amidst scientific and technological cumulative achievements. Beyond the polarized classical positions of reductionism and holism, scientomics could also propose new conceptual tools for scientific integration and planning, and for research management.",39,3,153,164,Epistemology; Mechanism (philosophy); Sociology; Cognition; Reductionism; Holism; Living systems; Knowledge organization; Scientometrics; Information science,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2012-3-153 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=25920381,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2012-3-153,,10.5771/0943-7444-2012-3-153,2467922858,,0,,5

139-415-373-727-671,A new conception of Representation of knowledge,,2004,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Rosa San Segundo,"The new term Representation of knowledge, applied to the framework of electronic segments of information, with comprehension of new material support for information, and a review and total conceptualisation of the terminology which is being applied, entails a review of all traditional documentary practices. Therefore, a definition of the concept of Representation of knowledge is indispensable. The term representation has been used in western cultural and intellectual tradition to refer to the diverse ways that a subject comprehends an object. Representation is a process which requires the structure of natural language and human memory whereby it is interwoven in a subject and in conscience. However, at the present time, the term Representation of knowledge is applied to the processing of electronic information, combined with the aim of emulating the human mind in such a way that one has endeavoured to transfer, with great difficulty, the complex structurality of the conceptual representation of human knowledge to new digital information technologies. Thus, nowadays, representation of knowledge has taken on diverse meanings and it has focussed, for the moment, on certain structures and conceptual hierarchies which carry and transfer information, and has initially been based on the current representation of knowledge using artificial intelligence. The traditional languages of documentation, also referred to as languages of representation, offer a structured representation of conceptual fields, symbols and terms of natural and notational language, and they are the pillars for the necessary correspondence between the object or text and its representation. These correspondences, connections and symbolisations will be established within the electronic framework by means of different models and of the goal domain, which will give rise to organisations, structures, maps, networks and levels, as new electronic documents are not compact units but segments of information. Thus, the new representation of knowledge refers to data, images, figures and symbolised, treated, processed and structured ideas which replace or refer to documents within the framework of technical processing and the recuperation of electronic information.",31,2,106,111,Artificial intelligence; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Body of knowledge; Natural language; Natural language processing; Data science; Knowledge organization; Open Knowledge Base Connectivity; Computer science; Terminology; Documentation; Knowledge management; Information science,,,,,,,,,2472632394,,0,,1

The domain that has been chosen is human nervous system (HNS) disorders. It is hypothesized here that an ontology-based patient records management system is more effective in meeting and addressing complex information needs of health-care personnel. Therefore, this study has been based on the premise that developing an ontology and using it as a component of the search interface in hospital records management systems will lead to more efficient and effective management of health-care. It is proposed here to develop an ontology of the domain of HNS disorders using a standard vocabulary such as MeSH or SNOMED CT. The principal classes of an ontology include facet analysis for arranging concepts based on their common characteristics to build mutually exclusive classes. We combine faceted theory with description logic, which helps us to better query and retrieve data by implementing an ontological model. Protégé 5.2.0 was used as ontology editor. The use of ontologies for domain modelling will be of acute help to doctors for searching patient records. In this paper we show how the faceted approach helps us to build a flexible model and retrieve better information. We use the medical domain as a case study to show examples and implementation. </p>",46,3,187,198,World Wide Web; Ontology; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-187,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-187,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-187,2954498350,,0,,0

Diverse UGC sources and information overload are making it increasingly difficult to satisfy personalized information needs. To organize UGCs in a user-centered way, we should not only map them based on textual topics but also link them with users and even user communities. We propose a multi-dimensional framework to organize information by connecting UGCs, users, and user communities. First, we use a topic model to generate a topic hierarchy from UGCs. Second, an author-topic model is applied to learn user interests. Third, user communities are detected through a label propagation algorithm. Finally, a multi-dimensional information organization pattern is formulated based on similarities among the topic hierarchies of UGCs, user interests, and user communities.

145-162-485-543-214,Episemantics: Aboutness as Aroundness,,2019,journal article,KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION,09437444,Nomos Verlag,Germany,Elliott Hauser; Joseph T. Tennis,"<p>Aboutness ranks amongst our field’s greatest bugbears. What is a work about? How can this be known? This mirrors debates within the philosophy of language, where the concept of representation has similarly evaded satisfactory definition. This paper proposes that we abandon the strong sense of the word aboutness, which seems to promise some inherent relationship between work and subject, or, in philosophical terms, between word and world. Instead, we seek an etymological reset to the older sense of aboutness as “in the vicinity, nearby; in some place or various places nearby; all over a surface.” To distinguish this sense in the context of information studies, we introduce the term episemantics. The authors have each independently applied this term in slightly different contexts and scales (Hauser 2018a; Tennis 2016), and this article presents a unified definition of the term and guidelines for applying it at the scale of both words and works. The resulting weak concept of aboutness is pragmatic, in Star’s sense of a focus on consequences over antecedents, while reserving space for the critique and improvement of aboutness determinations within various contexts and research programs. The paper finishes with a discussion of the implication of the concept of episemantics and methodological possibilities it offers for knowledge organization research and practice. We draw inspiration from Melvil Dewey’s use of physical aroundness in his first classification system and ask how aroundness might be more effectively operationalized in digital environments. </p>",46,8,590,595,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-590,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-590,,,0,,0

Many compound classes have been removed from the main tables, and more radical revisions of classes (particularly those for Medicine and Religion) have introduced a rigorous analysis, a clearer sense of citation order, and building of compound classes according to a more logical system syntax. The faceted approach provides a means of formalizing the relationships in the classification and making them explicit for machine recognition. In the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (BC2) (which has been a source for both UDC classes mentioned above), terminologies are encoded for automatic generation of hierarchical and associative relationships. Nevertheless, difficulties are encountered in vocabulary control, and a similar phenomenon is observed in UDC. Current work has revealed differences in the vocabulary of humanities and science, notably the way in which terms in the humanities should be handled when these are semantically complex. Achieving a balance between rigour in the structure of the classification and the complexity of natural language expression remains partially unresolved at present, but provides a fertile field for further research.",37,4,270,279,Associative property; Natural language; Library classification; Information retrieval; Vocabulary; Faceted classification; Bliss Bibliographic classification; Computer science; Syntax; Rigour,,,,,http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/153366/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2010-4-270,,10.5771/0943-7444-2010-4-270,2265846087,,0,,7

Although it became India's de facto national classification system, it is falling into disuse, and its perpetuation as a viable system is currently jeopardised. The author identifies a number of reasons for this trend. For example, the CC lacks the institutional support that benefits other modern systems such as the DDC, UDC, and LCC.

The different approaches are discussed, with emphasis on the need for a controlled vocabulary in information retrieval. Assigned indexing, which employs a controlled vocabulary, is described in detail. Types of indexing language can be divided into two broad groups - those using pre-coordinated terms and those depending on post-coordination. They represent two different basic approaches in processing and information retrieval. The historical development of these two approaches is described, as well as the two tools that apply to these approaches: thesauri and subject headings.",29,2,87,93,Controlled vocabulary; Data mining; Artificial intelligence; Indexation; Natural language processing; Information retrieval; Computer science; Index term; Search engine indexing; Information processing,,,,,,,,,2523134079,,0,,6

The authors focus more specifically on the morpho-syntactic issues by describing their morpho-syntactic analysis platform, which has been implemented to cover the automatic indexing and information retrieval topics. To this end they implemented the Cascaded Augmented Transition Network (ATN). They used this formalism in order to analyse French text descriptions of Multimedia documents. An implementation of an ATN parsing automaton is briefly described. The Platform in its logical operation is considered as an investigative tool towards the knowledge organization (based on an NP -Noun Phrase- recognition model) and management of multiform e(electronic)-documents (text, multimedia, audio, image) using their text descriptions.",29,,171,180,Knowledge extraction; Noun phrase; Artificial intelligence; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Parsing; Augmented transition network; Natural language; Natural language processing; Information retrieval; Automatic indexing; Knowledge organization; Computer science,,,,,,,,,2518446138,,0,,0

Linguistic differences still form a major obstacle to scientific, cultural, and educational exchange. Besides this linguistic diversity, a multitude of databases and collections now contain documents in various formats, which may also adversely affect the retrieval process. This paper describes a research project aiming to verify the existing relations between two indexing approaches: traditional image indexing recommending the use of controlled vocabularies or free image indexing using uncontrolled vocabulary, and their respective performance for image retrieval, in a multilingual context. This research also compares image retrieval within two contexts: a monolingual context where the language of the query is the same as the indexing language; and a multilingual context where the language of the query is different from the indexing language. This research will indicate whether one of these indexing approaches surpasses the other, in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the image searchers. This paper presents the context and the problem statement of the research project. The experiment carried out is also described, as well as the data collection methods.",1,1,105,106,Controlled vocabulary; Data collection; Image retrieval; Natural language; Problem statement; Information retrieval; Vocabulary; Multilingualism; Computer science; Knowledge management; Search engine indexing,,,,,http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/download/12839/11320,http://dx.doi.org/10.7152/nasko.v1i1.12839,,10.7152/nasko.v1i1.12839,2037062654,,0,013-932-222-386-140,3

Brandhorst,"It has rarely been seen as a task for art history to give systematic, consistent and detailed access to the subject matter of large numbers of historical images. This lack of systematic documentation severely handicaps all historical research that involves the interpretation of iconographic detail. It leaves us unable to count the frequency with which subjects have been represented, or with which iconographic particularities occur. This article asks whether the use of the iconographic classification system ICONCLASS will help to create countable iconographic information. Its first part deals with the considerations that have guided the shape of the computer edition that has recently been made available. These may be relevant for the electronic publication of classification systems in general. In the second part a few statement about gestures are analyzed against the background of an existing corpus of systematically described images . This analysis draws attention to the paradox that iconographic detail often plays a key role in art historical discourse, but must do so on the basis of incidental information",20,1,12,19,Countable set; Comparative historical research; Document retrieval; Gesture; Subject access; Subject matter; Computer science; Linguistics; Iconography; Documentation; Knowledge management,,,,,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=4925072 http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1993-1-12,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1993-1-12,,10.5771/0943-7444-1993-1-12,2485363636,,0,,1

The other case study shows a textbook on the World Wide Web that is connected to various other sources of information. About half the book references are to web sites, and the textbook is part of an online course that is connected to an online catalog and other courses.

Given the descriptive character of such analysis, it can be valuable for Information Science (IS), as it provides a picture of the variation in author abstracts, depending on the discipline, culture and language of the author, and the envisaged context. The authors claim that such knowledge can be useful for information professionals who need to revise author abstracts, or use them for other activities in the organization of knowledge, such as subject analysis and control of vocabulary. With this purpose in mind, we summarize various findings of ESP research. We describe how abstracts vary in structure, content and discourse, and how linguists explain such variations. Other factors taken into account are the stylistic and discoursal features of the abstract, lexical choices, and the possible sources of bias. In conclusion, we show how such findings can have practical and theoretical implications for IS.",32,2,64,78,Content analysis; Vocabulary; Information structure; Scientific literature; Genre analysis; Subject analysis; Computer science; Linguistics; Added value; Information science,,,,,,,,,2519399152,,0,,10

NAICS is the industry classification scheme used by the governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States to carry out their respective economic censuses. NAICS is considered a rational system that uses the underlying economic principle of similar production processes as the basis for its classes. For the Information Sector of the economy, as formulated in NAICS, a key production process is the acquisition and defense of copyright. With open source, copyleft licensing eliminates copyright acquisition and protection as major production processes, suggesting that the open source software industry warrants a separate NAICS category. More importantly, our analysis suggests that NAICS cannot be understood as a taxonomy of objective economic activity but is instead a politically and historically contingent system of data classification.",32,3,117,127,North American Industry Classification System; Copyleft; New economy; Knowledge organization; Data classification; Intellectual property; Industrial organization; Computer science; Knowledge management; Industrial production; Industry classification,,,,,https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/measuring-the-new-economy-industrial-classification-and-open-sour,https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/measuring-the-new-economy-industrial-classification-and-open-sour,,,2462440606,,0,,1

Tennis,"What theoretical framework can help in building, maintaining and evaluating networked knowledge organization resources? Specifically, what theoretical framework makes sense of the semantic prowess of ontologies and peer-to-peer systems, and by extension aids in their building, maintenance, and evaluation? I posit that a theoretical work that weds both formal and associative (structural and interpretive) aspects of knowledge organization systems provides that framework. Here I lay out the terms and the intellectual constructs that serve as the foundation for investigative work into experientialist classification theory, a theoretical framework of embodied, infrastructural, and reified knowledge organization. I build on the interpretive work of scholars in information studies, cognitive semantics, sociology, and science studies. With the terms and the framework in place, I then outline classification theory's critiques of classificatory structures. In order to address these critiques with an experientialist approach an experientialist semantics is offered as a design commitment for an example: metadata in peer-to-peer network knowledge organization structures.",32,2,79,92,Epistemology; Semantics; Ontology (information science); Science studies; Ontology; Knowledge organization; Information structure; Computer science; Knowledge management; Cognitive semantics; Metadata,,,,,http://faculty.washington.edu/jtennis/Publications_files/Tennis2005KO32-2.pdf https://digital.lib.washington.edu:443/researchworks/handle/1773/37980,https://digital.lib.washington.edu:443/researchworks/handle/1773/37980,,,76761297,,0,007-593-303-160-927; 025-500-979-213-459; 028-064-043-010-663; 034-800-264-534-436; 036-018-967-090-600; 038-249-176-007-541; 040-076-670-791-772; 042-313-593-252-159; 043-508-776-570-156; 044-737-699-270-744; 059-438-671-773-803; 063-647-309-381-503; 064-979-192-032-082; 066-260-254-459-029; 067-915-699-238-959; 078-861-392-728-687; 092-736-012-017-002; 098-447-863-714-372; 106-717-038-738-054; 130-254-464-720-190; 142-255-262-450-284; 148-571-180-308-199; 181-072-396-769-365; 188-192-965-023-127,11

Riesthuis,"The study: Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) (Specifications fonctionnelles des notices bibliographiques) was commissioned by IFLA and published in 1998. It defines the core functions of a catalogue (and bibliographic records) as a gateway to information. For that purpose an abstract entity-relationship model of a catalogue is proposed. The FRBR model is revolutionary. The (computer) catalogue is not seen as a sequence of bibliographic records and a replica of the traditional card catalogue, but rather as a network of connected entities, enabling the user to perform seamlessly all the necessary functions. So far there has been some theoretical discussion of the model and some limited experiments, but there is a lack of research in how to implement this theoretical model in practice, in new-generation catalogues. In this paper some reactions to the model are analysed. The main focus is on consequences of the model for the OPAC interface design, particularly the searching functionality and display of results.",29,2,78,86,World Wide Web; Default gateway; Standardization; Replica; Cataloging; Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records; Computer science; S-box; Library catalog; User interface,,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2F012641e5-d9ce-41d3-972a-b63f2126d96d,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2F012641e5-d9ce-41d3-972a-b63f2126d96d,,,2096759819,,0,,6

182-499-359-463-219,The Dewey decimal Classification and the transition from physical to electronic knowledge organisation,1999-03-01,1999,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Amanda Tinker; A. S. Pollitt; A. O'Brien; P. A. Braekevelt,"The physical organisation of items on library shelves using any classification scheme is inevitably a compromise. The best efforts to achieve an arrangement char is helpful to users will be thwarted by the multifaceted nature of these items and the specific needs of the user and the library. Items on a particular subject will be scattered throughout the library building(s) across disciplines, by physical form, by frequency of use and whether and for how long they may be borrowed. Even though the rich information content of multifaceted items may be represented in the notation, the items required by a user will be scattered across library shelves when the item is placed in a single relative location. This paper explores these issues using examples from a University Library classified using the Dea ey Decimal Classification Scheme (DDC). The electronic context of the library OPAC can transcend the constraints imposed by the predominantly physical nature of library collections, yet the current use of classification schemes in on-line systems retains many of these limitations. Examples of such systems applying DDC on the World Wide Web are discussed and compared with a system that seeks to use DDC in what is called view-based searching. The interface and the resulting browsing and searching capability of a View-Based Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) are described. Ways in which subject. access to library collections can be improved and disciplinary scatter resolved by assigning multiple class numbers to items and exploiting the rich Dewey structure in a faceted form are discussed. It is suggested that the informative power of visual classificatory structures at the search interface will be beneficial to the broader learning experience of the user. The paper concludes that the application of classification schemes in electronic interfaces should not be bound by the physical constraints that no longer apply in an electronic context but be exploited to provide a complete, flexible and individual interface as determined by the needs of each user.",26,2,80,96,The Internet; Dewey Decimal Classification; World Wide Web; Library classification; Information retrieval; Electronic document; Computer science; Notation; Compromise; Decimal; Discipline,,,,,https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/publications/the-dewey-decimal-classification-and-the-transition-from-physical http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/32471/,https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/publications/the-dewey-decimal-classification-and-the-transition-from-physical,,,2303947694,,0,,11

At the most superficial level notation can correspond to the hierarchical structure of the schedules or link to literal components. The notation of compound concepts can express the structure and composition of the compound, and systems exist in which symbols denote the functional roles of the constituent elements and the relationships between them. At the highest level notation can be used to mirror the actual structure of those entities which it represents, as in the case of mathematical systems or chemical compounds. Methods of displaying these structures are examined, and the practicality in a documentary context is questioned, with particular reference to recent revision work on the chemistry class of the Bliss Bibliographic Classification 2nd edition (BC2).",26,3,140,148,Data mining; Artificial intelligence; Coding (social sciences); Chemistry education; Natural language processing; Bliss Bibliographic classification; Semantic relation; Computer science; Linguistics; Notation; Engineering notation; Expressivity,,,,,,,,,25330035,,0,,2

Who is participating in this discipline’s scholarly discussion, and from what locations, both geographically and intellectually? Using the unit of authorship in the journal Knowledge Organization, where is the nexus of KO activity, and what patterns of authorship can be identified? What indices can be generated to describe the KO community of researchers as it has evolved? Cultural characteristics were applied as a lens to explore who is and is not participating in the international conversation about KO. World Bank GNI per capita estimates were used to compare relative wealth of countries and Hofstede’s Individualism dimension was identified as a way of understanding attributes of countries whose scholars are participating in this dialog.

A key challenge in work centered design of classification schemes is the evolving semantics of work. This article introduces a work centered approach to the design of classification schemes, based on the framework of cognitive work analysis. We launch collaborative task situations as a new unit of analysis for capturing evolving semantic structures in work domains. An example case from a cognitive work analysis of three national film research archives illustrates the application of the framework for identifying actors' needs for a classification scheme to support collaborative knowledge integration. It is concluded that a main contribution of the new approach is support for empirical analysis and overall design of classification schemes that can serve as material interfaces for actors' negotiations and integration of knowledge perspectives during collaborative work.",30,,213,227,Data mining; Semantics; Classification scheme; Domain analysis; Cognition; Negotiation; Domain knowledge; Cognitive work analysis; Computer science; Unit of analysis; Knowledge management,,,,,,,,,2491147806,,0,,14

Riggs,"In both Onomantics and Terminology there are about a half-dozen core concept which overlap but do not coincide with each other. They include what is called representation, description, cue, tag and notation in Onomantics and, in Terminology, definition, designation, term, symbol and name. A lexicographer writing a synonymy for such words might compare their meanings to show how they resemble or differ from each other, using a Semantic (words-to-meanings) point of view. To compare concepts (not words) in an Onomantic (Ana-Semantic, or concept-to-tag) context, one needs to compare the descriptions (definitions) of each concept to see whether they, indeed, have the same or different essential characteristics. One also needs to compare the notations that situate each concept in a system - even if the definitions of two concepts are almost the same, one might discover that because two concepts are positioned differently in their respective classification schemes, they are conceptualized differently. Finally, the concept tags (terms) used to represent each concept can also be compared semantically, i.e. to see whether their connotations and additional meanings support or hamper the unambiguous recognition of each intended concept. After an introductory display of the two sets of concepts, each of those used in Terminology is compared systematically, using all three sets of comparisons, with the nearest equivalent concepts used in Onomantics",23,3,147,168,Lexicology; Symbol; Classification scheme; Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Computer science; Linguistics; Notation; Terminology; Synonym; Lexicography,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-147-1 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2875506,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-147-1,,10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-147-1,2253456979,,0,,1

194-391-518-246-985,Fundamentals of Knowledge organization,,2003,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Birger Hjerland,"This article is organized in 10 sections: (1) Knowledge Organization (KO) is a wide interdisciplinary field, much broader than Library and Information Science (LIS). (2) Inside LIS there have been many different approaches and traditions of KO with little mutual influence. These traditions have to a large extent been defined by new technology, for which reason the theoretical integration and underpinning has not been well considered. The most important technology-driven traditions are: a) Manual indexing and classification in libraries and reference works, b) Documentation and scientific communication, c) Information storage and retrieval by computers, d) Citation based KO and e) Full text, hypertext and Internet based approaches. These traditions taken together define very much the special LIS focus on KO. For KO as a field of research it is important to establish a fruitful theoretical frame of reference for this overall field. This paper provides some suggestions. (3) One important, theoretical distinction to consider is the one between social and intellectual forms of KO. Social forms of KO are related to professional training, disciplines and social groups while intellectual organization is related to concepts and theories in the fields to be organized. (4) The social perspective includes in addition the systems of genres and documents as well as the social system of knowledge producers, knowledge intermediaries and knowledge users. (5) This social system of documents, genres and agents makes available a very complicated structure of potential subject access points (SAPs), which may be used in information retrieval (IR). The basic aim of research in KO is to develop knowledge on how to optimise this system of SAPs and its utilization in IR. (6) SAPs may be seen as signs, and their production and use may be understood from a social semiotic point of view. (7) The concept of paradigms is also helpful because different groups and interests tend to be organized according to a paradigm and to develop different criteria of relevance, and thus different criteria of likeliness in KO. (8) The basic unit in KO is the semantic relation between two concepts, and such relations are embedded in theories. (9) In classification like things are grouped together, but what is considered similar is not a trivial question. (10) The paper concludes with the considering of methods for KO. Basically the methods of any field are connected with epistemological theories. This is also the case with KO. The existing methods as described in the literature of KO fit into a classification of basic epistemological views. The debate about the methods of KO at the deepest level therefore implies an epistemological discussion.",30,2,87,111,Epistemology; Sociology; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Hypertext; Social system; Social group; Citation; Knowledge organization; Documentation; Information science,,,,,http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/catalog/21763019,http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/catalog/21763019,,,2492892086,,0,,83
