The study defines the concept of knowledge, distinguishes between subjective knowledge (i.e., knowledge as a thought in the individual's mind) and objective knowledge (i.e., knowledge as an independent object), establishes the necessity of knowledge organization in the construction of knowledge and its key role in the creation, learning, and dissemination of knowledge, and concludes with implications for the development of classification schemes and knowledge maps.",31,1,49,54,Epistemology; Classification scheme; Sociology; Cognitive map; Knowledge organization; Objective knowledge; Information science,,,,,,,,,2977891513,,0,037-025-648-608-400; 049-114-819-418-24X; 061-606-109-184-229; 093-637-585-548-014; 176-719-350-228-09X,9

Satija,"A book number takes shelf arrangement of documents to a point where classification per se cannot. Class number alone is not able to uniquely indivdiualise a document on the library shelves. The function of a book number starts from where that of the class number ends. An author number also brings together all the books by one author in one specific subject. A chronological book number will clearly portray the development of a subject over a given period. Book numbers are indispensable for a shelflist. The National Library (NL) of India at Kolkata has a collection of about 3 million documents. For organizing its contents it uses the DDC and the shelf arrangement is by Cutter's three figure author table. For Indian names it uses its home-made author table described here. Though the National Library table is designed especially for Indian names across all religions and regional cultures, yet its use outside the National Library has not been reported mostly due lack of marketing. Since 1961 the Indian cultural names have undergone many changes. The need is to revise and update the table to reflect the current culture and new authors across India.",34,1,34,40,World Wide Web; Sociology; Stock management; Library science; Class number; National library; Proper noun; Document processing,,,,,,,,,2494631402,,0,,1

One of the largest folksonomies on the Internet in terms of number of users and tagged websites is the computer program del.icio.us, where more than 100,000 people have tagged the websites that they and others find using their own keywords. How this is done in practice and the patterns to be found are the focus of this article. The empirical basis is the collection of 76,601 different keywords with a total frequency of 178,215 from 500 randomly chosen taggers on del.icio.us. at the end of 2005. The keywords collected were then analyzed quantitatively statistically by uncovering their frequency and percentage distribution and through a statistical correspondence analysis in order to uncover possible patterns in the users' tags. Subsequently, a qualitative textual analysis of the tags was made in order to find out by analysis which tagging strategies are represented in the data material. This led to four conclusions. 1) the distribution of keywords follows classic power law; 2) distinct tagging communities are identifiable; 3) the most frequently used tags are situated on a general-specific axis; and 4) nine distinct tagging strategies are observed. These four conclusions are put into perspective collectively in respect of a number of more general and theoretical considerations concerning folksonomies and the classification systems of the future.",34,3,115,127,The Internet; Empirical research; World Wide Web; Correspondence analysis; Information retrieval; Total frequency; Percentage distribution; Qualitative analysis; Computer science; Markup language; Social network,,,,,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=19954919 http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2007-3-115,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2007-3-115,,10.5771/0943-7444-2007-3-115,2460633067,,0,,18

Audio description is a voice added to the sound track of moving pictures to provide information for the visually impaired. We analyse two one-hour parts of a television production broadcast as a mini-series in 1997. We compare our results with those of a previous study, which identifies some of the characteristics of audio description and the associated moving image. We found close correspondence among some aspects studied and for other aspects much less correspondence, but for reasons we are able to explain. In addition, in the process of conducting the current study we further developed our methodology and now feel that it is a mature method for analysing audio description text as a source for generating indexing to the associated moving image.",31,4,222,230,Content analysis; Audio description; Audiovisual document; Television production; Visually impaired; Computer science; Multimedia; Search engine indexing; Broadcasting,,,,,,,,,2523968781,,0,,7

The authors analyze three weblogs (Biblioatipici, Letture and Andrea Marchitelli’s blog) to demonstrate that different contents may be classified using the appropriate scheme.; Biblioatipici is a weblog about temporary workers in libraries and Italian documentation centres, indexed with a faceted scheme, home made by authors. Letture, a diary about reading and books, is indexed by DDC; finally, Andrea Marchitelli’s blog, a weblog about digital libraries and open access, is indexed by JITA, the scheme used for indexing e-prints in some different open archives.; The three applications are presented starting from the most complex scheme (i.e. the faceted one) to the simple but least functional (JITA), passing through a traditional bibliographic classification scheme, the Dewey Decimal Classification.; The analysis demonstrates that different web contents can efficiently be classified with different schemes. In particular, with the facets one (Biblioatipici) the indexer is able to generate the needed classes in the indexing phase. Moreover with a small number of facets and foci one can obtain an exponential number of classes. Finally, one of the advantages for the user is that the faceted scheme allows multiple accesses on the basis of different information requirements, in addition to being coherent and intuitive. DDC scheme can be more suitable than the first web pages or blogs performing a sort of digital library. In this case in fact the DDC scheme constitutes a consolidated classification standard, widespread in a huge quantity of libraries and the use of a different scheme might get confusion. JITA scheme, finally, can find a huge applicability in web pages (or blogs) in LIS field showing several advantages: it’s very simple and essentialy pragmatic, intuitive and coherent. It’s a conservative scheme because structurally closed, in fact it does not allow the classifier to insert new LCS’s categories. If, from a certain point of view, this is a disadvantage, vice versa this feature is really useful because get a complete matching between classes of all the web pages implemented with it.",33,1,35,44,Dewey Decimal Classification; World Wide Web; Library classification; Web page; Information retrieval; Web indexing; Content management; Computer science; Digital library; Indexer; Search engine indexing,,,,,http://eprints.rclis.org/8778/ https://works.bepress.com/andrea_marchitelli/1/,http://eprints.rclis.org/8778/,,,1605904596,,0,013-595-252-334-822; 016-837-561-042-047; 038-249-176-007-541; 066-915-178-556-066; 150-754-933-797-462,8

D'ambrosio,"This investigation was undertaken to explore the prospect of using the repertory grid structured interview technique as a tool for creating metadata. The following question is considered: Could Repertory Grid technique be used as a tool in the creation of metadata? It is postulated that repertory grid technique may be used as a tool for creating metadata labels, or tags, where the labels or tags describe entities, which may be images, documents or expressions. Repertory grid technique can provide a method for examining the detail about an individual's mental models, or personal construct systems of lifeworld entities, which may include images, documents or expressions. The question were considered by looking at the results of an earlier study, which explored the personal constructs of systems analysts using the repertory grid technique to examine the mental conceptualizations that determine the extent of difference in conceptualization. Categorical core areas of expressions used during software requirements development emerge through classification of the conceptualizations of expressions elicited via the repertory grid interviews. Repertory grid also reveals, through cluster analysis, the subtle difference in the way each participant conceptually related one expression to another expression. The differences in conceptual relationship of expressions or concepts could represent insight about how people view entities of a lifeworld. In a situation where metadata are used to label entities of a lifeworld for organization and retrieval of information, the differences in conceptual relationships might influence the metadata created and how they are used in the lifeworld for the organization and retrieval of information.",34,1,41,57,Structured interview; World Wide Web; Repertory grid; Knowledge organization; Lifeworld; Computer science; Software requirements; Expression (mathematics); Conceptualization; Metadata,,,,,,,,,2523514315,,0,,1

Sharma; Schubert Foo; Miguel A. Morales-Arroyo,"The organisation of knowledge for exploitation and re-use in the modern enterprise is often a most perplexing challenge. The entire knowledge management life-cycle (for example - create, capture, organize, store, search, and transfer) is impacted by the organisation of intellectual capital into a corporate taxonomy or at the least a knowledge map (often incorrectly used interchangeably). Determining the extent to which such an objective is achieved is the focus of what is known as a knowledge audit. In this practice-oriented article, the authors review the fundamentals of creating a taxonomy, the use of meta-data in a necessary process known as classification and the role of expertise locators where the knowledge is not explicit but resides within experts in the form of tacit knowledge. The authors conclude with a framework for developing a corporate taxonomy and how such a project may be executed. The conceptual contribution of this article is the postulation that corporate taxonomies that are designed to facilitate knowledge audits lead to greater organizational impact.",35,1,30,46,Organizational learning; Body of knowledge; Personal knowledge management; Domain knowledge; Knowledge mobilization; Tacit knowledge; Corporate taxonomy; Computer science; Knowledge management; Knowledge engineering,,,,,http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/sfoo/publications/2008/2008Knowledge-Organisation_fmt.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1258162 https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/sfoo/publications/2008/2008Knowledge-Organisation_fmt.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-1-30,,10.5771/0943-7444-2008-1-30,2257917619,,0,008-114-752-924-078; 017-656-465-905-31X; 020-750-244-497-219; 021-555-019-032-303; 026-787-086-442-120; 026-789-374-196-699; 028-495-225-718-392; 030-136-936-524-671; 039-535-007-979-765; 044-095-698-738-18X; 045-119-187-307-855; 050-405-450-488-904; 072-098-766-057-116; 100-096-010-419-783; 102-747-722-959-349; 111-638-345-430-012; 144-119-328-498-560; 145-873-495-611-066; 199-838-864-346-794,6

The latter include eliminating ambiguity, controlling synonyms or equivalents, establishing explicit semantic relationships such as hierarchical and associative relationships, and presenting both relationships and properties of concepts in the knowledge models. Examples of KOS include lists, authority files, gazetteers, synonym rings, taxonomies and classification schemes, thesauri, and ontologies. These systems model the underlying semantic structure of a domain and provide semantics, navigation, and translation through labels, definitions, typing, relationships, and properties for concepts. The term knowledge organization systems (KOS) is intended to encompass all types of schemes for organizing information and promoting knowledge management, such as classification schemes, gazetteers, lexical databases, taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies (Hodge 2000). These systems model the underlying semantic structure of a domain and provide semantics, navigation, and translation through labels, definitions, typing, relationships, and properties for concepts (Hill et al. 2002, Koch and Tudhope 2004). Embodied as (Web) services, they facilitate resource discovery and retrieval by acting as semantic road maps, thereby making possible a common orientation for indexers and future users, either human or machine (Koch and Tudhope 2003, 2004).",35,2-3,160,182,Embodied cognition; Semantics; Associative property; Ontology (information science); Information system; Information retrieval; Knowledge organization; Ambiguity; Computer science; Synonym,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-160 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=20613691,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-160,,10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-160,2473206977,,0,005-288-279-802-34X,82

An overview is presented of the essential elements of critical race theory, including clarifications of the meanings of some important terms such as “race” and “social justice.” On the basis of a review of existing conceptions of the just and the antiracist library service, a rationale is presented for hypothesizing that critical race theory may be of use to the library and information sciences. The role of classification schemes as information institutions in their own right is established, and the Dewey Decimal Classification is introduced as the case to be studied. The challenges faced by classification-scheme designers in the construction and/or reconstruction of race-related categories are reviewed; and an analysis is presented of one sense in which it might be suggested that recent (2003) revisions in one of the DDC’s tables appear not to meet those challenges wholly successfully. An account is given of a further sense in which adoption of a critical race-theoretic approach has the more radical effect of calling into question a fundamental decision recently taken to “deracialize” the DDC. In conclusion, an assessment is made of critical race theory as a framework for evaluating library classification schemes.",34,3,144,168,Epistemology; Dewey Decimal Classification; Classification scheme; Racism; Sociology; Library classification; Critical race theory; Service information; Information science,,,,,https://works.bepress.com/furner/14/download/ https://works.bepress.com/furner/14/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2007-3-144,,10.5771/0943-7444-2007-3-144,2128385741,,0,005-855-262-964-375; 013-710-360-492-466; 019-725-389-896-835; 023-415-661-258-48X; 028-908-906-309-044; 029-041-684-554-50X; 031-569-098-270-093; 033-898-669-534-938; 046-843-911-802-501; 048-138-748-732-150; 051-205-335-136-823; 056-798-318-790-928; 058-582-509-007-852; 059-248-758-802-999; 059-438-671-773-803; 064-979-192-032-082; 067-864-293-420-163; 070-814-769-721-563; 072-562-174-683-531; 084-806-549-347-002; 089-039-641-726-029; 091-092-189-619-757; 093-342-291-216-462; 098-167-914-533-752; 124-644-779-996-614; 124-670-931-800-743; 130-310-027-965-441; 141-127-501-591-306; 142-255-262-450-284; 148-571-180-308-199; 154-178-816-668-461; 159-184-001-397-050; 161-019-767-227-71X; 174-812-603-865-761; 176-594-815-080-114; 185-402-672-734-56X; 185-953-741-131-799; 186-320-819-181-283; 189-770-651-771-913,35

There were in total, nine quality controlled SGs that were functional for shorter or longer periods of time. Their typology and functionality is described. Quality SGs have evolved and the role of classification has changed accordingly from supporting subject organization on the interface and automatic categorization of resources, towards supporting a semantic linking, control and vocabulary mapping between different indexing systems in subject hubs and federated SGs. In this period, many SGs ceased to exist and little information remains available regarding their status. SGs currently using UDC, for some part of their resource organization, do not use a UDC subject hierarchy at the interface and its role in resource indexing has become more difficult to observe. Since 2000, UDC has become more prevalent in East European SGs, portals and hubs, which are outside the scope of this research. This paper is an attempt to provide a record on this particular application of UDC and to offer some consideration of the changes in requirements when it comes to the use of library classification in resource discovery.",33,2,67,85,The Internet; World Wide Web; Library classification; Vocabulary; Subject access; Hierarchy; Computer science; Search engine indexing; Typology; Categorization,,,,,http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/bitstream/10150/105276/1/UDCSG_AS_preprint.pdf https://arizona.openrepository.com/handle/10150/105276,https://arizona.openrepository.com/handle/10150/105276,,,1535096990,,0,002-349-572-668-052; 004-811-285-204-925; 005-124-764-796-384; 016-654-378-045-985; 018-209-067-439-431; 026-330-240-989-555; 026-513-176-440-016; 036-033-226-770-284; 056-415-932-948-210; 056-528-258-959-188; 062-053-043-216-046; 065-345-393-226-571; 066-623-418-243-110; 066-921-382-891-76X; 067-078-838-549-576; 067-584-582-110-958; 068-018-986-918-179; 070-277-249-353-807; 074-770-537-516-695; 077-834-632-222-483; 090-178-684-776-910; 096-603-327-420-505; 097-188-919-197-440; 109-106-259-238-594; 121-601-940-139-223; 122-264-668-606-057; 139-766-916-788-345; 158-636-445-534-536; 166-021-140-655-029; 174-204-429-297-383; 189-419-676-302-410,6

López-Huertas,"The research dynamics of knowledge organization (KO) show a tendency towards the reformulation of previous questions in the new technology-driven and interdisciplinary context of KO. Current research questions in KO are dominated by a noteworthy interest in quality, related not only to the informational contents recorded in knowledge organization systems (KOS) but also to technical and technological considerations. The integration of knowledge would seem to constitute a quality indicator present in most proposals, and it also responds to the need for KOS with frameworks comprehensible for all user sectors, respecting the diversity of users. The flip side of knowledge integration entails the conjugation of technical, formal and technological aspects, well represented by the word interoperability, or the search for a way to simplify and harmonize the great variety of structures and formats that coexist in the Internet. This paper addresses the aforementioned major research concerns expressed in the last decade of KO literature. It is structured into two broad sections: 1) A demand for quality, touching on research questions related to multilingualism, cross-culturalism, social groups, minorities and ethics, as well as the integration of structures, forms and formats and the respective proposals by scholars; and 2) A demand for managing emergent knowledge in KOS, with a discussion of how to represent and organize work-oriented and organizational knowledge domains, where multidimensional knowledge (multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinarity) is addressed together with the responses put forth by various researchers.",35,2-3,113,136,The Internet; Social group; Interoperability; Information policy; Knowledge organization; Multilingualism; Research questions; Computer science; Knowledge integration; Knowledge management,,,,,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=20613688,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-113,,10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-113,59344961,,0,,19

Conceptual content relationships include, in turn, interconcept and intraconcept relationships. The expression of interconcept relationships is covered by standard thesaural relationships, which typically do not distinguish fully between the underlying lexical relationship types. The full expression of complex intraconcept relationships includes indication of the basic nature of the relationship (including a set of semantic roles), the set of entities that participate in the relationship, and a mapping between participants and semantic roles.

In this paper, focused on hierarchical relations, different aspects of the relational semantics of thesauri, and among them the possibility of developing richer structures, are analyzed. Thesauri are viewed as semantic tools providing, for operational purposes, the representation of the meaning of the terms. The paper stresses how theories of semantics, holding different perspectives about the nature of meaning and how it is represented, affect the design of the relational semantics of thesauri. The need for tools capable of representing the complexity of knowledge and of the semantics of terms as it occurs in the literature of their respective subject fields is advocated. It is underlined how this would contribute to improving the retrieval of information. To achieve this goal, even though in a preliminary manner, we explore the possibility of setting against the framework of thesaurus design the notions of language games and hermeneutic horizon.",34,4,197,214,Recall; Controlled vocabulary; Semantics; Artificial intelligence; Kripke semantics; Natural language processing; Knowledge organization; Semantic relation; Search terms; Computer science,,,,,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=20134729 http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2007-4-197,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2007-4-197,,10.5771/0943-7444-2007-4-197,2527415343,,0,,38

The experimentation was carried out on conceptual mapping and Petri Nets, developed collaboratively online with the aid of the CMapTool and WoPeD graphic applications. Two distinct professional communities have been involved in the research, both pertaining to the Local Health Units in Tuscany. One community is made up of head physicians and health care managers whilst the other is formed by technical staff from the Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene. It emerged from the experimentation that concept maps are considered more effective in analyzing knowledge domain related to the problem to be faced (description of what it is). On the other hand, Petri Nets are more effective in studying and formalizing its possible solutions (description of what to do to).

We briefly introduce the beginning and principles of folksonomy and discuss the categorizing concept of folksonomies on the basis of the computer program delicious. The selection of the metadata tagged is not accidental, rather tagging follows a pattern that proves to be the pattern for the classic power law, which, in many complex systems is seen to unfold as an imitation-dynamic that creates an asymmetry, where a few descriptive metadata are often reproduced and the majority seldom reproduced. In del.icio.us, it is the very broadband basic subject headings that are often reproduced and achieve power in the system - which in cognitive psychology is called cognitive basic categories - while the small, more specific subject headings are seldom reproduced. The law of power's underlying imitation-dynamic in del.icio.us is explained from the perspective of different theoretical paradigms, i.e. network, economy and cognition. The theorectical and speculative conclusion is that the law of power and asymmetry is biased by a cognitive economizing through a simplification principle in the users' construction of descriptive metadata. Free tagging in folksonomies is comparable to empirical experiments in free categorization. Users often choose broad basic categories, because that requires the least cognitive effort. The consequences are that folksonomy is not necessarily a better, more realistic and cheaper method of creating metadata than that which can be generated through taxonomies, faceted classification or search algorithms. Folksonomy as a self-organizing system likely cannot create better and cheaper descriptive metadata.",34,1,16,33,Cognition; Information retrieval; Folksonomy; Faceted classification; Computer science; Markup language; Complex system; Social network; Metadata; Categorization,,,,,,,,,2473030389,,0,,25

While the design and construction of controlled vo-cabularies have been prescribed at the technical level in great detail over the past decades, the methodological level has been somewhat neglected. However, classification research has in recent years focused on developing approaches to the analysis of users, domains, and activities that could produce requirements for the design of controlled vocabularies. Researchers have of-ten argued that the design, construction, and use of controlled vocabularies need to be based on analyses and understandings of the contexts in which these controlled vocabularies function. While one would assume that the growing body of research on human information behavior might help guide the development of controlled vocabularies shed light on these contexts, unfor-tunately, much of the research in this area is descriptive in nature and of little use for systems design. This paper discusses these trends and outlines a holistic approach that demonstrates how the design of controlled vocabularies can be informed by inves-tigations of people’s interactions with information. This approach is based on the Cognitive Work Analysis framework and outlines several dimensions of human-information interactions. Application of this approach will result is a comprehensive un-derstanding of the contexts in which the controlled vocabulary will function and which can be used for the development of for the development of controlled vocabularies.",35,1,16,29,Controlled vocabulary; Classification scheme; Cognitive work analysis; Information behavior; Knowledge organization; Systems design; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://jenserikmai.info/Papers/2008_CVDesign.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-1-16,,10.5771/0943-7444-2008-1-16,89398202,,0,002-469-218-702-269; 005-288-279-802-34X; 005-766-981-957-927; 022-114-540-021-94X; 028-138-506-770-052; 029-275-535-129-990; 032-928-209-758-445; 035-234-319-611-842; 035-263-247-754-424; 038-981-980-657-737; 042-947-575-406-294; 043-281-866-549-314; 044-788-042-840-810; 047-722-747-471-725; 048-780-301-089-363; 056-023-122-194-370; 057-338-048-083-471; 058-561-035-474-236; 060-142-663-052-283; 064-979-192-032-082; 075-970-159-737-492; 077-112-458-112-240; 078-304-746-038-64X; 079-790-902-905-032; 087-831-676-456-440; 092-443-662-293-245; 092-574-183-104-523; 103-709-846-156-125; 110-243-849-964-365; 110-352-421-546-560; 130-264-225-723-086; 140-563-581-743-828; 141-145-576-773-920; 148-137-662-153-570; 148-705-787-905-169; 161-752-846-263-489; 173-092-050-492-440; 173-436-477-348-620; 174-857-541-059-519; 182-864-646-837-95X; 185-841-695-900-406; 194-556-078-156-224; 195-790-238-445-343,20

An approach being discussed considers the intrinsic semantics of texts of documents. Based on the hypothesis that noun phrases in a text are semantically rich in terms of their ability to represent the subject content of the document, this approach seeks to identify and extract noun phrases instead of single keywords, and use them as descriptors.

The need for such bilingual microglossaries on subsections of a subject field for LSP teaching and translation purposes is emphasized in the Introduction. The concept""learner's glossary' is delimited among other types of terminological collections such as a specialised dictionary, a thesaurus and a term bank in Section 2 where the information categories in an entry are specified (keyterm plus translation equivalent(s), definition of keyterm and exemplary context, narrower terms with synonyms, definitions and translation equivalents; special phrases based on keyterm collocations with translation equivalents and exemplary contexts). Section 3 describes the principles and working methods of modern terminography as well as the source materials available for the glossary compilation. A hybrid term extraction technique is also described in that section and is used to extract the candidate terms with subsequent manual initial processing of the results. In Section 4 the theoretical grounds and methodology for analysing the conceptual relations in a terminological system are presented including the expert validation of the automatically extracted terms as a first phase in that process. Rationale for applying a lexico-semantic analysis in identifying collocational information on the keyterms is provided in Section 5 which is proposed to involve descriptions of the actantial structure of a keyterm for identifying verbal (T+v) collocations and of the paradigmatic and syntagmatic morpho-syntactic relations applicable to a keyterm.

In other words, the ""core"" concept and ""anchored"" concept are mutually supportive of one another. These two concepts can be linked with other concepts to produce more extended and robust knowledge structures in memory. This study used a flow map method to identify learner's ""core"" and ""anchored"" concepts derived from the treatment instruction about thermal physics. The results showed that with the assistance of ""core"" concept, profitably mediated by the ""anchored"" concept, learners could recall more extended knowledge, with greater richness and with higher connection than in the absence of this organizing information (Experiment 1). However, the difference between the provision of a group core concept and an individual core concept did not reach any significance level in the recall task two-month later (Experiment 2). When the recall task was carried out six months later, the group ""anchored"" concept showed the essential assistance to the recall of knowledge (Experiment 3).

The purpose of the investigation was to determine what information should be taken into account when designing systems for organizing information in such businesses, and how these businesses actually organize their electronic documents. The investigation of the systems in use also presented the opportunity to gather business concepts that were used to construct a generic classification scheme for the purpose of information organization in small enterprises. Data were gathered from 24 small businesses located in three different provinces by means of personal interviews with owners/managers, guided by a questionnaire, and through on-site observation of the information organization systems used. The results of the survey show what information is regarded as critically important in small businesses, and give insight into the current situation with regard to information organization in the businesses. Recommendations are made for improving information organization in small businesses.",31,1,4,25,Information management; Classification scheme; Business; Information system; Small business; Electronic document; Electronic information; Economic information; Operations research; Knowledge management; Information needs,,,,,http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/79195,http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/79195,,,2159002364,,0,,1

Sicilia; Salvador Sánchez-Alonso,"Ontology editors are software tools that allow the creation and maintenance of ontologies through a graphical user interface. As the semantic web effort grows, a larger community of users for this kind of tool is expected. New users include people not specifically skilled in the use of ontology formalisms. In consequence, the usability of ontology editors can be viewed as a key adoption precondition for semantic web technologies. In this paper, the usability evaluation of several representative ontology editors is described. This evaluation is carried out by combining a heuristic pre-assessment with a subsequent user-testing phase. The target population is comprised of people with no specific ontology-creation skills that have a general knowledge about domain modelling. For this kind of user, current editors are adequate for the creation and maintenance of simple ontologies. Also, there is room for improvement, especially in browsing mechanisms, help systems, and visualization metaphors.",32,1,1,9,World Wide Web; Process ontology; Ontology (information science); Usability; Semantic Web; Ontology-based data integration; Computer science; OWL-S; Suggested Upper Merged Ontology; Upper ontology,,,,,http://www.cc.uah.es/ssalonso/papers/Garcia_Sicilia_Sanchez_KO.pdf,http://www.cc.uah.es/ssalonso/papers/Garcia_Sicilia_Sanchez_KO.pdf,,,2515929539,,0,003-154-544-577-061; 010-612-528-348-006; 015-263-245-445-999; 019-053-667-776-931; 025-929-743-572-676; 027-902-180-573-212; 033-963-776-011-874; 035-062-890-313-627; 037-131-151-842-460; 044-112-946-898-10X; 048-540-118-537-807; 050-022-468-150-663; 068-510-263-293-675; 068-801-494-333-443; 069-089-627-994-051; 077-719-362-591-268; 090-056-671-326-472; 141-194-881-145-446; 160-343-813-385-97X; 162-312-028-303-693; 173-475-611-021-752,16

KO as a field of study is concerned with the nature and quality of such knowledge organizing processes (KOP) as well as the knowledge organizing systems (KOS) used to organize documents, document representations and concepts. There exist different historical and theoretical approaches to and theories about KO, which are related to different views of knowledge, cognition, language, and social organization. Each of these approaches tends to answer the question: ""What is knowledge organization?"" differently. LIS professionals have often concentrated on applying new technology and standards, and may not have seen their work as involving interpretation and analysis of meaning. That is why library classification has been criticized for a lack of substantive intellectual content. Traditional human-based activities are increasingly challenged by computer-based retrieval techniques. It is appropriate to investigate the relative contributions of different approaches; the current challenges make it imperative to reconsider this understanding. This paper offers an understanding of KO based on an explicit theory of knowledge.",35,2-3,86,101,Sociology; Cognition; Body of knowledge; Library classification; Knowledge organization; Intellectual content; Knowledge management; Search engine indexing; Social organization,,,,,http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/106183,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-86,,10.5771/0943-7444-2008-2-3-86,37511596,,0,008-059-612-903-583; 023-927-221-065-800; 032-996-453-495-055; 062-724-086-574-032; 068-737-899-308-007; 071-206-267-554-061; 080-945-058-659-719; 097-082-429-956-664; 101-181-440-980-872; 118-826-118-594-79X; 148-018-898-936-764; 152-638-811-043-763; 161-936-604-849-125; 187-630-733-190-162; 189-726-704-382-172,95

Subjects attached to records representing cited works are compared to subjects attached to records representing the original citing sources, and to the subjects yielded by chasing see-also references from the latter group of headings. Original citing sources were yielded via a subject-list search in a library catalog using the subject heading ""Language and languages - Origin."" A subject-search was employed to avoid subjectivity in choosing sources. References from the sources were searched in OCLC where applicable, and the subject headings were retrieved. The subjects were ranked first by number of citations from original sources, then by total citation-frequency. The results were tiered into four groups in a Bradford-like distribution. A similar rank and division was performed on the subjects representing the original citing sources, and those yielded by chasing see-also references. Both in terms of subject frequency and topic type, positive comparisons between citation-chasing and see-also references show a confirmation of different methods of yielding alternative subjects. Exclusive results suggest potential mutual complementary value among these different methods.",33,2,86,95,Citation analysis; Ranking; Subjectivity; Information retrieval; Subject access; Topic type; Bibliometric analysis; Computer science; Library catalog,,,,,,,,,2500381087,,0,,1

Its findings can be relevant to knowledge organization, and models of knowledge can, in turn, offer relevant ontological suggestions. Several philosophers in time have pointed out that reality is structured into a series of integrative levels, like the physical, the biological, the mental, and the cultural, and that each level plays as a base for the emergence of more complex levels. More detailed theories of levels have been developed by Nicolai Hartmann and James K. Feibleman, and these have been considered as a source for structuring principles in bibliographic classification by both the Classification Research Group (CRG) and Ingetraut Dahlberg. CRG's analysis of levels and of their possible application to a new general classification scheme based on phenomena instead of disciplines, as it was formulated by Derek Austin in 1969, is examined in detail.

139-415-373-727-671,A new conception of Representation of knowledge,,2004,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Rosa San Segundo,"The new term Representation of knowledge, applied to the framework of electronic segments of information, with comprehension of new material support for information, and a review and total conceptualisation of the terminology which is being applied, entails a review of all traditional documentary practices. Therefore, a definition of the concept of Representation of knowledge is indispensable. The term representation has been used in western cultural and intellectual tradition to refer to the diverse ways that a subject comprehends an object. Representation is a process which requires the structure of natural language and human memory whereby it is interwoven in a subject and in conscience. However, at the present time, the term Representation of knowledge is applied to the processing of electronic information, combined with the aim of emulating the human mind in such a way that one has endeavoured to transfer, with great difficulty, the complex structurality of the conceptual representation of human knowledge to new digital information technologies. Thus, nowadays, representation of knowledge has taken on diverse meanings and it has focussed, for the moment, on certain structures and conceptual hierarchies which carry and transfer information, and has initially been based on the current representation of knowledge using artificial intelligence. The traditional languages of documentation, also referred to as languages of representation, offer a structured representation of conceptual fields, symbols and terms of natural and notational language, and they are the pillars for the necessary correspondence between the object or text and its representation. These correspondences, connections and symbolisations will be established within the electronic framework by means of different models and of the goal domain, which will give rise to organisations, structures, maps, networks and levels, as new electronic documents are not compact units but segments of information. Thus, the new representation of knowledge refers to data, images, figures and symbolised, treated, processed and structured ideas which replace or refer to documents within the framework of technical processing and the recuperation of electronic information.",31,2,106,111,Artificial intelligence; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Body of knowledge; Natural language; Natural language processing; Data science; Knowledge organization; Open Knowledge Base Connectivity; Computer science; Terminology; Documentation; Information science,,,,,,,,,2472632394,,0,,1

By understanding the differences between these two disciplines, as well as the areas of inquiry within knowledge organization that are essential to the successful implementation of knowledge management systems, a wide field of fruitful research directions becomes apparent for both knowledge organization and knowledge management researchers.",34,1,9,15,Organizational learning; Personal knowledge management; Knowledge organization; Correlation analysis; Wide field; Knowledge environment; Computer science; Knowledge management; Knowledge engineering,,,,,,,,,2473294358,,0,,3

Slovenian public libraries have traditionally used UDC as the only subject information on belles-lettres. Research has shown that users would prefer richer subject information. Therefore an attempt was made to enhance UDC by adding subject information, that should be helpful to users and librarians. The newly proposed Alternative Model system contains lists of verbal and alpha-numerical denotations for the basic groups of belles-lettres book material (main-genres: lyrics, drama, epics) and all other categorical criteria (language of the original literary work, literature to which the work belongs, genre, sub-genre) and half-categorical (accessibility of the content of literary works, origin within the periods of literary history, the century in which the literary work was written, the rhythm of the language). All these lists are available, but not included in this paper. The idea of the Alternative Model system is to show the possibilities of making the classification of belles-lettres in libraries more helpful, efficient and exact.",33,4,204,214,World Wide Web; Sociology; History of literature; Document management system; Lyrics; Belles-lettres; Subject access; Knowledge organization; Drama; Categorical variable,,,,,,,,,2480237440,,0,,5

To better understand whether searchers consider classificatory structures a viable alternative to information retrieval, this article reports on a study of how 24 library and information science students used Yahoo! directories, a popular search service resembling classification, in completing an assigned simple task. Several issues emerged from the students' reporting of their search process and a comparison between hierarchical navigation and keyword searching: citation order of facets, precision vs. recall, and other factors influencing searchers' successes and preferences. The latter included search expertise, knowledge of the discipline, and time required to complete the search.

The authors claim that such knowledge can be useful for information professionals who need to revise author abstracts, or use them for other activities in the organization of knowledge, such as subject analysis and control of vocabulary. With this purpose in mind, we summarize various findings of ESP research. We describe how abstracts vary in structure, content and discourse, and how linguists explain such variations. Other factors taken into account are the stylistic and discoursal features of the abstract, lexical choices, and the possible sources of bias.

The metadata elements that evince the most frequently inaccurate, inconsistent and incomplete DC metadata application are identified. As well, the most frequently occurring locally added metadata elements and associated pattern development are examined. For this, a randomly collected sample of 659 metadata item records from three digital image collections is analyzed. Implications and issues drawn from the evaluation of the current status of metadata creation and mapping are also discussed in relation to the issue of semantic interoperability of concept representation across digital image collections. The findings of the study suggest that conceptual ambiguities and semantic overlaps inherent among some DC metadata elements hinder semantic interoperability. The DC metadata scheme needs to be refined in order to disambiguate semantic relations of certain DC metadata elements that present semantic overlaps and conceptual ambiguities between element names and their corresponding definitions. The findings of the study also suggest that the development of mediation mechanisms such as concept networks that facilitate the metadata creation and mapping process are critically needed for enhancing metadata quality.",33,1,20,34,Semantic grid; World Wide Web; Meta Data Services; Metadata repository; Synonym ring; Information retrieval; Data element; Semantic equivalence; Computer science; Database catalog; Metadata,,,,,,,,,2514068595,,0,,26

NAICS is the industry classification scheme used by the governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States to carry out their respective economic censuses. NAICS is considered a rational system that uses the underlying economic principle of similar production processes as the basis for its classes. For the Information Sector of the economy, as formulated in NAICS, a key production process is the acquisition and defense of copyright. With open source, copyleft licensing eliminates copyright acquisition and protection as major production processes, suggesting that the open source software industry warrants a separate NAICS category. More importantly, our analysis suggests that NAICS cannot be understood as a taxonomy of objective economic activity but is instead a politically and historically contingent system of data classification.",32,3,117,127,Business; North American Industry Classification System; Copyleft; New economy; Knowledge organization; Data classification; Intellectual property; Industrial organization; Industrial production; Industry classification,,,,,https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/measuring-the-new-economy-industrial-classification-and-open-sour,https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/measuring-the-new-economy-industrial-classification-and-open-sour,,,2462440606,,0,,1

Here I lay out the terms and the intellectual constructs that serve as the foundation for investigative work into experientialist classification theory, a theoretical framework of embodied, infrastructural, and reified knowledge organization. I build on the interpretive work of scholars in information studies, cognitive semantics, sociology, and science studies.
