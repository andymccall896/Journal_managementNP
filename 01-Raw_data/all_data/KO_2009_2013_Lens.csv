001-254-322-670-872,Why public libraries in sweden did nor choose Dewey.,2010-01-01,2010,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Joacim Hansson,"The article identifies two distinct sections, one within the public library sphere and one in academic libraries, relevant for the development of a unique Swedish classification system (the SAB-system) to be used in public libraries. These are used to analyse the social and discursive influences that led to a rejection of the DDC as the common classification system for the public libraries in Sweden. The author analyses the debate that took place in the 1910s in various publications and identifies theoretical as well as some practical reasons for rejecting the DDC. Reference is also made to the situation in Norway and Denmark at this time and their attempts to influence Sweden to accept the DDC as had been done in these countries. Conclusions are drawn that the reasons for rejection of the DDC not only is to be sought in theoretical or even practical problems regarding the system itself but in the academic library sector which, through the SAB-system, could create a lasting influence on the knowledge organisation in public libraries in order to uphold the national identity of the Swedish library system",24,3,145,153,Sociology; Library science; Library classification; Disadvantage; National identity; Academic library; Knowledge organisation,,,,,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:292515,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:292515,,,392260780,,0,,1

After examining precedents, we discuss the methodology used and its application. The aim of the project was to provide visibility to information contained in these historical documents which would otherwise have remained inaccessible and to do so in the clearest, most rigorous, and most useful way possible for both the specialized user and the general public. The use of information technology as a management tool is not as common in archives, especially historical archives, as in other documentation areas such as libraries. A pilot project was therefore set up to create an intranet support for managing four specific historical archives containing documents dating from the 13 th to the 20 th centuries. The most important part of this project was that of exploring the viability of constructing a thesaurus to become part of the automated program for archive description and checking.",38,2,153,166,Information technology; Visibility; Engineering; World Wide Web; Library science; Intranet; Management tool; Documentation,,,,,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=24274265 http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-154,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-154,,10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-154,2524040766,,0,,2

Information retrievals of web users from 01/01/2003 to 01/01/2006 on the internal search engine of the pilot digital library have been analyzed. With the power law method of data processing, a constant information retrieval pattern has been established, stable over a longer period of time. After this, the data have been analyzed. On the basis of the accomplished measurements and analyses, a series of mental models of web users for global (educational) purposes have been developed (e.g., the metamodel of thought hierarchy of web users, the segmentation model of web users), and the users were profiled in four different groups (adventurers, observers, applicable, and know-alls). The article concludes with the construction of a new knowledge management solution called multidimensional rank thesaurus.",38,2,96,113,Data mining; Data processing; Profiling (computer programming); Association rule learning; Information retrieval; Hierarchy; Computer science; Digital library; Knowledge management; Metamodeling; Segmentation; Hierarchical clustering,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-96 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=24274261,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-96,,10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-96,2526410924,,0,035-753-073-379-418; 090-885-354-392-642; 101-021-300-225-610; 105-614-742-799-485; 106-469-865-732-588; 115-918-357-438-638; 186-280-256-567-292,3

FRBR describes four different levels of entities (i.e., Work, Expression, Manifestation, and Item), which provide a distinguishing understanding of each entity in the bibliographic universe. In this research, since the scope of data analysis focuses on tags assigned to web documents, consideration on Manifestation and Item has been excluded. Accordingly, only the attributes of Work and Expression entity were investigated in order to map the attributes of tags to attributes defined in those entities. The content analysis on tag attributes was conducted on a total of 113 web documents regarding 11 attribute categories defined by FRBR. The findings identified essential bibliographic attributes of tags and tagging behaviors by subject. The findings showed that concerning specific subject areas, taggers exhibited different tagging behaviors representing distinctive features and tendencies. These results have led to the conclusion that there should be an increased awareness of diverse user needs by subject in terms of the practical implications of metadata generation.",39,4,233,254,Entity–relationship model; Conceptual model; World Wide Web; Content analysis; Information retrieval; Cataloging; Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records; Social tags; Subject areas; Computer science; Metadata,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2012-4-233 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=26220881,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2012-4-233,,10.5771/0943-7444-2012-4-233,2468024838,,0,,3

Authorial stance has been widely studied in linguistics and is a typical feature of scientific writing that reveals the uniqueness of each author's perspective, their scientific contribution, and their thinking. We argue that authorial stance guides the reading of scientific documents and that it can be used to characterize the knowledge contained in such documents. Our research has previously shown that people reading dissertations are interested both in a topic and in a document's authorial stance. Now, we would like to propose a two-tiered indexing system. Dissertations would first be divided into paragraphs; then, each information unit would be defined by topic and by the markers of authorial stance present in the document.",39,4,292,299,World Wide Web; Scientific writing; Computer science; Linguistics; Search engine indexing,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2012-4-292 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=26220887,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2012-4-292,,10.5771/0943-7444-2012-4-292,2528165389,,0,,5

His main interest is classification theory. He has published papers on this subject in several international journals and conference pro- ceedings. He is member of the scientific advisory boards of the Universal Decimal Classification Con- sortium (UDCC) and of the journal Knowledge Organization, and vice-president of the International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO). Gnoli, Claudio. Classification Transcends Library Business. Knowledge Organization, 37(3), 223-229. 26 references. Abstract: Although bibliographic classifications usually adopt a perspective different from that of object classifications, the two have obvious relationships. These become especially relevant when users are looking for knowledge scattered in a wide va- riety of forms and media. This is an increasingly common situation, as library catalogues now coexist in the global digital envi- ronment with catalogues of archives, of museums, of commercial products, and many other information resources. In order to make the subject content of all these resources searchable, a broader conception of classification is needed, that can be applied to any knowledge item, rather than only bibliographic materials. To illustrate this we take an example of the research on bag- pipes in Northern Italian folklore. For this kind of research, the most effective search strategy is a cross-media one, looking for many different knowledge sources such as published documents, police archives, painting details, museum specimens, organi- zations devoted to related subjects. To provide satisfying results for this kind of search, the traditional disciplinary approach to classification is not sufficient. Tools are needed in which knowledge items dealing with a phenomenon of interest can be re- trieved independently from the other topics with which it is combined, the disciplinary context, and the medium where it oc- curs. This can be made possible if the basic units of classification are taken to be the phenomena treated, as recommended in the Leon Manifesto, rather than disciplines or other aspect features. The concept of bagpipes should be retrievable and browsable in any combination with other phenomena, disciplines, media etc. Examples are given of information sources that could be managed by this freely-faceted technique of classification.",37,3,223,229,Folklore; Universal Decimal Classification; Library classification; Painting; Data science; Manifesto; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Phenomenon; Discipline,,,,,http://www-dimat.unipv.it/gnoli/gnoli2010.pdf https://www-dimat.unipv.it/gnoli/gnoli2010.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2010-3-223,,10.5771/0943-7444-2010-3-223,2183630767,,0,007-154-405-661-138; 009-250-243-917-382; 009-859-469-551-600; 033-203-507-437-875; 046-308-014-520-294; 062-493-798-375-845; 068-112-917-094-066; 093-118-965-830-64X; 093-342-291-216-462; 098-507-725-113-618; 110-269-455-474-000; 122-667-315-891-776; 122-746-647-303-059; 127-482-211-718-005; 190-947-914-672-957; 193-627-707-985-201,10

The paper outlines recent conceptual moves in knowledge organization re- search and shows that contemporary classification theory is based on a pragmatic understanding of the world. It suggests that unjust state- ments and assumptions about the world challenge contemporary library classifications and that a proper response is needed. It outlines a framework for the development of ethical classifications based on MacIntyre's practice-based ethical theory. It provides a framework within which editors and managers of library classifications can make ethically sound decisions.,40,4,242,253,Political science; Morality; Knowledge organization; Ethical theory; Management science; Engineering ethics,,,,,http://jenserikmai.info/Papers/2013_Ethics.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2013-4-242,,10.5771/0943-7444-2013-4-242,2340829411,,0,007-452-417-696-587; 009-307-159-811-053; 010-666-201-096-349; 011-389-959-101-643; 025-945-792-658-628; 029-275-535-129-990; 032-388-474-318-614; 042-401-029-005-536; 042-965-285-376-401; 045-643-328-405-899; 054-767-050-361-481; 058-870-933-249-646; 059-438-671-773-803; 062-058-206-673-640; 064-979-192-032-082; 080-945-058-659-719; 081-562-866-534-429; 083-103-671-012-428; 087-831-676-456-440; 089-285-072-653-723; 103-101-119-589-404; 120-964-024-592-598; 123-985-997-137-067; 125-568-022-593-703; 133-244-016-296-955; 135-120-936-631-160; 142-521-850-154-819; 148-571-180-308-199; 151-573-269-790-142; 158-161-971-700-796; 173-558-572-143-805; 186-320-819-181-283,15

031-650-207-787-672,The Blind Men and the Elephant: Towards an Organization of Epistemic Contexts †,,2013,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Michael Kleineberg,"In the last two decades of knowledge organization (KO) research, there has been an increasing interest in the context-dependent nature of human knowledge. Contextualism maintains that knowledge is not available in a neutral and objective way, but is always interwoven with the process of knowledge production and the prerequisites of the knower. As a first step towards a systematic organization of epistemic contexts, the concept of knowledge will be considered in its onto- logical (WHAT) and epistemological (WHO) including methodological (HOW) dimensions. In current KO research, however, either the contextualism is not fully implemented (classification-as-ontology) or the ambition for a context-transcending universal KOS seems to have been abandoned (classification-as-epistemology). Based on a combined ontology and epistemology it will be argued that a phenom- ena-based approach to KO as stipulated by the Leon Manifesto, for example, requires a revision of the underlying phenomenon concept as a relation between the known object (WHAT) and the knowing subject (WHO), which is constituted by the application of specific meth- ods (HOW). While traditional subject indexing of documents often relies on the organizing principle ""levels of being"" (WHAT), for a fu- ture context indexing, two novel principles are proposed, namely ""levels of knowing"" (WHO) and ""integral methodological pluralism"" (HOW).",40,5,340,364,Epistemology; Psychology; Ontology; Subject indexing; Manifesto; Organizing principle; Knowledge organization; Contextualism; Phenomenon; Search engine indexing,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Kleineberg/publication/262536324_The_Blind_Men_and_the_Elephant_Towards_an_Organization_of_Epistemic_Contexts/links/0deec537f3ff88954a000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2013-5-340,,10.5771/0943-7444-2013-5-340,2380223529,,0,000-593-470-194-572; 000-842-953-631-532; 002-974-570-615-591; 004-292-606-497-684; 005-381-168-447-96X; 006-262-509-827-966; 006-898-808-427-86X; 008-722-364-848-025; 014-807-313-107-542; 014-893-997-453-035; 017-349-318-774-487; 018-339-500-580-432; 025-695-726-174-626; 028-876-504-591-573; 029-585-851-567-89X; 030-823-114-403-410; 032-345-627-150-032; 035-234-319-611-842; 037-746-279-805-31X; 055-536-355-424-496; 056-709-260-660-68X; 057-138-108-978-546; 059-010-591-283-903; 059-228-824-060-850; 061-018-838-320-648; 062-058-206-673-640; 062-493-798-375-845; 063-695-860-170-851; 063-846-135-421-940; 064-943-535-487-472; 067-705-677-831-473; 068-577-816-419-175; 068-770-808-461-538; 072-020-365-696-056; 073-121-443-222-147; 078-370-387-091-320; 078-720-828-099-06X; 080-440-311-115-122; 083-563-257-477-972; 084-387-669-392-808; 085-973-648-458-300; 086-267-164-845-070; 091-393-515-281-763; 096-244-369-239-278; 098-507-725-113-618; 098-533-945-081-821; 106-183-710-958-642; 108-456-330-076-545; 111-172-438-042-172; 111-524-198-620-573; 113-047-029-142-957; 114-510-959-296-600; 115-103-678-238-330; 116-363-024-783-492; 119-108-849-691-323; 119-764-929-762-051; 124-042-860-131-409; 124-090-743-733-669; 129-518-699-808-841; 132-467-835-509-16X; 135-590-085-412-336; 144-396-902-476-40X; 146-586-701-703-282; 150-972-531-595-388; 153-017-318-509-51X; 153-968-348-839-273; 163-347-342-369-208; 163-652-925-706-860,8

It is necessary to develop CS taxonomy research to combine its historical perspective, its current knowledge and its predicted future trends - including all breakthroughs in information and communication technology. In this paper we have analyzed the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) by means of visualization maps. The important achievement of current work is an effective visualization of classified documents from the ACM Digital Library. From the technical point of view, the innovation lies in the parallel use of analysis units: (sub)classes and keywords as well as a spherical 3D information surface. We have compared both the thematic and semantic maps of classified documents and results presented in Table 1. Furthermore, the proposed new method is used for content-related evaluation of the original scheme.

Satija,"Sears List of Subject Headings (Miller and McCarthy 2010), first published in 1923, is now in its 20 th edition. Like most subject headings lists, apart from being a list of preferred (and non-preferred) headings, it also provides patterns, clear instructions, and examples for coining new subject headings not explicitly listed. Key headings form a vital part of the system of coining new headings. It is proposed that more key headings should be designated. Some candidate headings are described. One far-reaching provision seems to be the use of a subdivision of a preferred heading with all of its NTs. Thus, every preferred heading is a potential key heading for all of its NTs. This proposal works on the principle that what is true of a class is true of its narrower classes of all types.

Scribbled in the margins 1 are notes to self, keywords, subject headings? “tags”? to remind us of why this particular passage was relevant to us. These scribbles include notes about the thoughts, subjects, eloquent linguistics that we wish to remember, and to access at a later time, maybe even our thoughts that occurred as we read the words.

Fox; Austin Reece,"Social tagging has been lauded for providing a voice of the user community, free of restrictions dictated by knowledge organization standards for subject access. Tagging allows many perspectives to be represented, but at what cost? Using deconstruction, Derrida argues that absolute hospitality is required to ensure justice for access and inclusiveness; however, the consequence becomes that the host becomes hostage to the other. In this ongoing research, we explore the Derridean concept of hospitality as it relates to social tagging, examining the consequences of unconditional inclusiveness, the process of discerning constraints to hospitality in order to interpret different kinds of ""otherness""—or what Derrida (2000, 75) calls the ""impossible"" decision—and what mitigation means, using the social tagging environment to illustrate.",4,1,53,69,Hospitality; Epistemology; Deconstruction; Sociology; Social exclusion; Subject access; Knowledge organization; Public relations,,,,,http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/download/14645/12289 http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/view/14645,http://dx.doi.org/10.7152/nasko.v4i1.14645,,10.7152/nasko.v4i1.14645,2021504714,,0,,2

Benson,"This article is concerned with ontology and its applications in Knowledge Organization (KO) activities. Connec- tions are drawn between efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) to capture the meaning of information and make it accessible to machines and the efforts made in libraries to use KO tools in machine-based record building and search and retrieval systems. The practices used in AI that are of interest here include ontology and ontology-based knowledge representation. In this article their applications in KO are directed towards a particularly problematic document type—the photograph. There are two argu- ments motivating this article. First, ontology-based KO systems that join AI techniques with library cataloging practices make it possible to utilize higher levels of expressivity when describing photographs. Second, KO systems for photographs that are capable of reasoning over concepts and relationships can potentially provide richer, more relevant search results than systems utilizing word-matching alone.",38,2,79,95,World Wide Web; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Ontology (information science); Ontology; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Library catalog; Expressivity,,,,,http://www.star-host.com/OntoPhoto.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-79,,10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-79,2514172930,,0,021-736-440-602-931; 025-929-743-572-676; 026-712-844-452-082; 026-787-086-442-120; 032-412-066-177-119; 046-870-323-010-229; 048-347-999-836-422; 051-869-706-830-737; 053-180-165-944-442; 060-543-292-212-918; 069-912-821-468-387; 071-603-002-923-860; 072-559-753-492-492; 100-935-111-075-54X; 108-881-422-982-85X; 117-516-248-698-589; 142-429-227-545-138; 146-494-787-462-687; 148-477-553-142-347; 161-271-744-129-759; 161-579-608-646-365; 171-308-985-462-228; 180-118-751-642-014,4

Archivists have a fundamental obligation to preserve and protect the authenticity and integrity of records in their holdings and, at the same time, have the responsibility to promote the use of records as a fundamental purpose of the keeping of archives (SAA 2005 Code of Ethics for Archivists V & VI). Is it an ethical practice that digital content in digital archives is deeply embedded in its contextual structure and generally underrepresented in digital archival systems? Similarly, is it ethical for archivists to detach digital items from their archival context in order to make them more ""digital friendly"" and more accessible to meet needs of some users? Do archivists have an obligation to bring the two representation systems together so that the context and content of digital archives can be better represented and archival materials ""can be located and used by anyone, for any purpose, while still remaining authentic evidence of the work and life of the creator""?

The results show certain query formulation patterns associated with searching in an emerging and interdisciplinary area of nanotechnology such as: the use of multiword and compound query terms, extensive use of search terms beginning with the prefix ""nano,"" hyphenated terms, spelling variations, a large number of query reformulations, and the use of acronyms. The results also indicate that 62% of the unique top terms resulting from mapping users' query terms to the INSPEC Classification codes represented two or more disciplines, specifically terms associated with the Classification code ""A"" representing ""physics.""

048-127-750-639-998,UDC and folksonomies,,2010,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Alenka Šauperl,"Social tagging systems, known as ‘folksonomies’, represent an important part of web resource discovery as they enable free and unrestricted browsing through information space. Folksonomies consisting of subject designators (tags) assigned by users, however, have one important drawback: they do not express semantic relationships either hierarchical or associative between tags. As a consequence, the use of tags to browse information resources requires moving from one resource to another, based on coincidence and not on the pre-established meaningful or logical connections that may exist between related resources. We suggest that the semantic structure of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) may be used in complementing and supporting tag-based browsing. In this work, two specific questions were investigated: (1) Are terms used as tags in folksonomies included in the UDC? and (2) Which facets of UDC match the characteristics of documents or information objects that are tagged in folksonomies?

I. Kipp,"This paper examines the context of online indexing from the viewpoint of three different groups: users, authors, and professional indexers. User tags, author keywords and descriptors were collected from academic journal articles, which were both indexed in Pubmed and tagged on CiteULike, and analysed. Descriptive statistics, informetric measures, and thesaural term comparison shows that there are important differences in the use of keywords between the three groups in addition to similarities which can be used to enhance support for search and browse. While tags and author keywords were found that matched descriptors exactly, other terms which did not match but provided important expansion to the indexing lexicon were found. These additional terms could be used to enhance support for searching and browsing in article databases as well as to provide invaluable data for entry vocabulary and emergent terminology for regular updates to indexing systems. Additionally, the study suggests that tags support organisation by association to task, projects and subject while making important connections to traditional systems which classify into subject categories.",38,3,245,261,Information retrieval; Vocabulary; Lexicon; Descriptive statistics; Computer science; Terminology; Search engine indexing,,,,,http://eprints.rclis.org/15227/ http://eprints.rclis.org/15227/1/kipp-2011-biomedicaltagging-kovol38.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-3-245,,10.5771/0943-7444-2011-3-245,1590506303,,0,002-852-458-537-866; 005-255-725-462-840; 006-061-426-560-599; 009-893-668-495-073; 011-981-882-161-607; 023-896-010-128-294; 036-706-153-054-917; 056-691-156-113-309; 063-174-909-674-61X; 066-915-178-556-066; 067-080-082-794-709; 067-865-739-836-871; 078-854-735-841-644; 080-249-519-797-470; 088-125-089-430-818; 088-478-983-368-784; 114-758-821-565-205; 124-055-238-548-83X; 132-384-476-148-433; 135-120-936-631-160; 152-613-117-717-093; 168-238-772-948-559; 168-466-197-336-584; 179-818-820-671-33X; 181-329-720-583-409; 182-872-147-730-736; 196-666-483-027-24X; 197-613-177-416-551,18

Trends and Patterns in Addressing the Current Issues and Challenges of Providing Subject Access,,2010,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Jack Hang-Tat Leong,"Resource description and discovery have been facilitated generally in two approaches, namely bibliographic control and metadata, which now may converge in response to current issues and challenges of providing subject access. Four categories of major issues and challenges in the provision of subject access to digital and non-digital resources are: 1) the advancement of new knowledge; 2) the fall of controlled vocabulary and the rise of natural language; 3) digitizing and networking the traditional catalogue systems; and 4) electronic publishing and the Internet. The creation of new knowledge and the debate about the use of natural language and controlled vocabulary as subject headings becomes even more intense in the digital and online environment. The third and fourth categories are conceived after the emergence of networked environments and the rapid expansion of electronic resources. Recognizing the convergence of metadata schemas and bibliographic control calls for adapting to the new environment by developing tools that exploit the strengths of both.",37,1,29,42,Controlled vocabulary; The Internet; World Wide Web; Exploit; Electronic publishing; Natural language; Subject access; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Metadata,,,,,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=24463508 http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2010-1-29,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2010-1-29,,10.5771/0943-7444-2010-1-29,2463025451,,0,,3

His main interest is classification theory. He has published papers on this subject in several international journals and conference pro- ceedings. He is a member of the scientific advisory boards of the Universal Decimal Classification Con- sortium (UDCC) and of the journal Knowledge Organization, and vice-president of the International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO). Gnoli, Claudio. Metadata About What? Distinguishing Between Ontic, Epistemic, and Documental Dimensions in Knowledge Organization. Knowledge Organization. 39(4), 268-275. 37 references. ABSTRACT: The spread of many new media and formats is changing the scenario faced by knowledge organizers: as printed monographs are not the only standard form of knowledge carrier anymore, the traditional kind of knowl- edge organization (KO) systems based on academic disciplines is put into question. A sounder foundation can be provided by an analysis of the different dimensions concurring to form the content of any knowledge item—what Brian Vickery described as the steps ""from the world to the classifier."" The ultimate referents of documents are the phenomena of the real world, that can be ordered by ontology, the study of what exists. Phenomena coexist in subjects with the perspectives by which they are considered, pertaining to epistemology, and with the formal features of knowledge carriers, adding a further, pragmatic layer. All these di- mensions can be accounted for in metadata, but are often done so in mixed ways, making indexes less rigorous and interoperable. For example, while facet analysis was originally developed for subject indexing, many ""faceted"" interfaces today mix subject fac- ets with form facets, and schemes presented as ""ontologies"" for the ""semantic Web"" also code for non-semantic information. In bibliographic classifications, phenomena are often confused with the disciplines dealing with them, the latter being assumed to be the most useful starting point, for users will have either one or another perspective. A general citation order of dimensions— phenomena, perspective, carrier—is recommended, helping to concentrate most relevant information at the beginning of head- ings.",39,4,268,275,Epistemology; Ontology (information science); Body of knowledge; Universal Decimal Classification; Ontology; Ontic; Subject indexing; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Metadata,,,,,http://www-dimat.unipv.it/~gnoli/gnoli2012.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2012-4-268,,10.5771/0943-7444-2012-4-268,2182084268,,0,008-283-550-062-243; 009-859-469-551-600; 010-837-954-398-185; 027-396-266-532-738; 029-696-149-461-94X; 038-249-176-007-541; 046-308-014-520-294; 048-841-863-051-646; 050-346-539-439-36X; 051-411-953-914-482; 052-694-680-995-326; 058-186-376-711-541; 068-112-917-094-066; 071-893-988-303-26X; 072-020-365-696-056; 087-831-676-456-440; 093-118-965-830-64X; 093-342-291-216-462; 098-314-043-447-003; 098-507-725-113-618; 098-981-178-271-366; 110-269-455-474-000; 129-202-026-489-574; 131-047-646-757-490; 133-637-302-325-670; 142-255-262-450-284; 148-143-435-462-315; 149-587-753-798-301; 153-017-318-509-51X; 156-598-760-048-637; 168-032-210-550-596,8

Domain Analysis Applied to the Literature of The FRBR Family of Conceptual Models,2013-10-31,2013,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Richard P. Smiraglia,"Domain analysis helps visualize the semantic intellectual content of a coherent group, or domain. A domain is a group with an ontological base, an underlying teleology, common hypotheses and epistemology, and social semantics. FRBR has spawned a family of conceptual models, and much writing. A recent second anthology about the FRBR models raises the question of whether a coherent domain has formed around the FRBR family. Domain analysis is used here to visualize the semantic content of the FRBR family domain, and to compare its two main component groups, scholar authors and practitioner authors. Results show a common teleology with some subtle differences surrounding implementation of the FRBR family of models.",4,1,174,185,Conceptual model; Artificial intelligence; Domain analysis; Cognitive science; Ontology; Social semantics; Intellectual content; A domain; Mathematics; Teleology,,,,,http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/download/14658/12301 http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/view/14658,http://dx.doi.org/10.7152/nasko.v4i1.14658,,10.7152/nasko.v4i1.14658,2076048144,,0,007-488-766-021-822; 013-993-917-540-609; 102-347-100-976-096; 176-375-254-109-852; 190-614-225-751-822,1

The model of scale-free networks, which has been recently developed and widely applied since, can be effectively used in terminology research as well. Operation based on the principle of networks is a universal characteristic of complex systems. Networks are governed by general laws. The model of scale-free networks can be viewed as a statistical-probability model, and it can be described with mathematical tools. Its main feature is that ‘everything is connected to everything else’, that is every node is reachable (in a few steps) starting from any other node; this phenomena called ‘the small world phenomenon’. The existence of a linguistic network and the general laws of the operation of networks enable us to place issues of language use in the complex system of relations that reveal the deeper connections between phenomena with the help of networks embedded in each other. The realization of the metaphor that language also has a network structure is the basis of the classification methods of the terminological system, and likewise of the ways of creating terminology databases, which serve the purpose of providing easy and versatile accessibility to specialised knowledge.",40,6,422,431,Network theory; Artificial intelligence; Metaphor; Network structure; Classification methods; Computer science; Complex system; Phenomenon; Terminology,,,,,http://real.mtak.hu/27031/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2013-6-422,,10.5771/0943-7444-2013-6-422,1682641436,,0,,2

In addition to some proposals set forth at the end of this contribution, ten desiderata appear urgent. A preliminary condition to any other consideration is the recognition of the fundamental difference in the organization of knowledge between the concept (i.e., the unit of knowledge)-the conceptual level-and the word, term or code-the verbal level-and the need for implementing this distinction in theory and practice (Desideratum 1). On this basis, some further proposals are enunciated. The 2 nd proposition concerns the surveying of extant classification systems, thesauri, and other means of organizing, ordering, and indexing knowledge; the 3 rd proposition envisages the improvement of expert training in Knowledge Organization (KO), also with regard to curricula and professional acknowledgment. Nr.4) refers to the professionalization of the hitherto rather neglected national ISKO secretariats, as well as the international ISKO secretariat.

089-926-127-972-615,Semantics in the Semantic Web: A Critical Evaluation †,,2011,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Maurício Barcellos Almeida; Renato Rocha Souza; Fred Fonseca,"In recent years, the term “semantics” has been widely used in various fields of research and particularly in areas related to information technology. One of the motivators of such an appropriation is the vision of the Semantic Web, a set of developments underway, which might allow one to obtain better results when querying on the web. However, it is worth asking what kind of semantics we can find in the Semantic Web, considering that studying the subject is a complex and controversial endeavour. Working within this context, we present an account of semantics relying on the main linguist approaches, in order to then analyze what semantics is within the scope of information technology. We critically evaluate a spectrum, which proposes the ordination of instruments (models, languages, taxonomic structures, to mention but a few) according to a semantic scale. In addition to proposing a new extended spectrum, the article suggests alternative interpretations with the aim of clarifying the use of the term “semantics” in different contexts. Finally, we offer our conclusions regarding the semantic in the Semantic Web and mention future directions and complementary works.",38,3,187,203,Semantic integration; Semantic analytics; Semantic search; Semantic Web Stack; Semantic Web; Information retrieval; Computer science; Semantic computing; Social Semantic Web; Semantic Web Rule Language,,,,,http://mba.eci.ufmg.br/downloads/SemanticsSemWebko_38_2011.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-3-187,,10.5771/0943-7444-2011-3-187,2333248141,,0,004-502-436-166-438; 006-469-811-332-671; 012-710-140-008-998; 013-081-786-072-873; 013-984-697-364-054; 015-721-104-106-921; 017-429-218-986-407; 021-736-440-602-931; 022-718-716-374-077; 029-922-310-274-896; 031-005-158-506-288; 038-769-999-176-206; 060-769-725-405-021; 068-930-003-699-346; 082-151-985-050-371; 088-516-454-211-575; 091-181-721-039-607; 092-728-395-461-388; 095-469-031-905-553; 095-686-223-024-567; 097-548-000-901-224; 101-967-517-926-853; 106-464-848-086-69X; 112-007-111-549-307; 115-120-484-431-356; 122-812-511-995-693; 126-584-690-684-180; 141-300-306-847-309; 157-778-888-473-573; 161-245-172-210-615; 161-271-744-129-759; 161-752-846-263-489; 172-139-950-828-260; 172-680-785-491-136; 174-416-939-791-132; 180-118-751-642-014,14

Domain ontologies are composed of concepts represented by domain relevant terms. Existing approaches of ontology construction make use of statistical and linguistic information to extract domain relevant terms. The quality and the quantity of this information influence the accuracy of terminologyextraction approaches and other steps in knowledge extraction and information retrieval. This paper proposes an approach forhandling domain relevant terms from Arabic non-diacriticised semi-structured corpora. In input, the structure of documentsis exploited to organize knowledge in a contextual graph, which is exploitedto extract relevant terms. This network contains simple and compound nouns handled by a morphosyntactic shallow parser. The noun phrases are evaluated in terms of termhood and unithood by ; means of possibilistic measures. We apply a qualitative approach, which weighs terms according to their positions in the structure of the document. In output, the extracted knowledge is organized as network modeling dependencies between terms, which can be exploited to infer semantic relations.We test our approach on three specific domain corpora. The goal of this evaluation is to check if our model for organizing and exploiting contextual knowledge will improve the accuracy of extraction of simple and compound nouns. We also investigate the role of compound nouns in improving information retrieval results.",38,6,473,490,Knowledge extraction; Noun phrase; Artificial intelligence; Ontology (information science); Parsing; Natural language processing; Information retrieval; Knowledge organization; Terminology extraction; Computer science; Rule-based machine translation; Terminology,,,,,https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/13573/ http://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/13573/,https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/13573/,,,122372052,,0,006-369-072-945-600; 013-353-791-759-027; 016-215-314-513-87X; 021-153-756-014-816; 022-125-426-170-494; 045-557-775-925-828; 049-298-568-964-535; 059-305-791-688-399; 060-405-466-699-397; 064-557-248-348-992; 075-437-579-721-547; 077-954-762-700-03X; 078-451-133-512-02X; 097-478-247-972-015; 100-776-066-387-564; 106-411-951-949-060; 119-899-552-062-239; 120-276-979-316-968; 121-965-456-152-853; 141-179-884-516-219; 142-646-584-040-382; 143-033-682-333-925; 144-998-073-995-226; 177-175-750-040-989; 177-591-933-478-599; 193-381-516-111-686,20

The idea of the network has influenced the conceptual thinking about both the web, and its wider socio-cultural influence. The paper develops an alternative description of the structure of hypertext and the web in terms of interrupted and dissipated energy flows. It concludes that the web should be considered not as a particular set of protocols and technological standards, nor as an interlinked set of technologically mediated services, but as a dynamic reorganisation of the socio-cultural system itself that at its inception has become associated with particular forms of technology, but which has no determinate boundaries, and which should properly be constituted in the spaces between technologies, and the spaces between persons.",40,6,414,421,World Wide Web; Hypertext; Conceptual thinking; Computer science,,,,,http://repository.londonmet.ac.uk/3804/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2013-6-414,,10.5771/0943-7444-2013-6-414,2811267371,,0,,2

103-364-820-610-122,Theories of knowledge organization — theories of knowledge,,2013,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Birger Hjørland,"Any ontological theory commits us to accept and classify a number of phenomena in a more or less specific way – and vice versa: a classification tends to reveal the theoretical outlook of its creator. Objects and their descriptions and relations are not just “given” but determined by theories. Knowledge is fallible and consensus is rare. By implication, knowledge organization has to consider different theories/views and their foundations. Bibliographical classifications depend on subject knowledge and on the same theories as corresponding scientific and scholarly classifications. Some classifications are based on logical distinctions, others on empirical examinations, and some on mappings of common ancestors or on establishing functional criteria. To evaluate a classification is to involve oneself in the research which has produced the given classification. Because research is always based more or less on specific epistemological ideals (e.g. empiricism, rationalism, historicism or pragmatism), the evaluation of classification includes the evaluation of the epistemological foundations of the research on which given classifications have been based. The field of knowledge organization itself is based on different approaches and traditions such as user-based and cognitive views, facet-analytical views, numeric taxonomic approaches, bibliometrics and domain-analytic approaches. These approaches and traditions are again connected to epistemological views, which have to be considered. Only the domain-analytic view is fully committed to exploring knowledge organization in the light of subject knowledge and substantial scholarly theories.",40,3,169,181,Epistemology; Common descent; Pragmatism; Cognition; Bibliometrics; Rationalism; Knowledge organization; Mathematics; Historicism; Empiricism,,,,,http://www.isko-de.org/data/uploads/KOAndTheoriesOfKnowlede.pdf https://www.isko-de.org/data/uploads/KOAndTheoriesOfKnowlede.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2013-3-169,,10.5771/0943-7444-2013-3-169,2310819976,,0,000-223-055-388-275; 004-539-738-688-96X; 006-135-103-600-460; 006-262-509-827-966; 014-938-315-102-251; 020-533-365-240-822; 021-650-435-025-714; 022-039-812-896-380; 025-945-792-658-628; 028-593-154-415-675; 033-194-916-965-503; 036-846-946-363-175; 040-589-590-844-268; 046-372-661-221-879; 056-709-260-660-68X; 060-142-663-052-283; 061-130-225-905-192; 062-724-086-574-032; 063-564-292-557-360; 072-805-533-577-663; 075-518-785-817-94X; 079-110-404-239-661; 083-103-671-012-428; 093-342-291-216-462; 109-321-719-727-13X; 125-404-239-928-083; 152-638-811-043-763; 153-017-318-509-51X; 180-718-985-578-94X; 194-556-078-156-224,22

105-100-051-441-427,Sexual Boundaries and Subcultural Discipline,,2012,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Patrick Keilty,"The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate that the mechanisms of power around classifications of gender and sexuality are not always top-down or bottom-up. Instead, the weight of social discipline among members of sexual subcultures themselves helps to create these classifications, often reflecting the nomenclature of subjects and desires within sexual subcultures in a complex relationship to a dominant culture. Critically examining two benchmarks in the development of sexual nomenclature within queer subcultures, this paper finds its evidence in George Chauncey's little known analysis (1985) of a navy investigation of male homosexuality at the Newport Naval Training Station during the World War I era and in contemporary folksonomic classifi- cations of representations of queer desire within Xtube, a database of online pornography. Social discipline within these sexual sub- cultures occurs in the stabilization of nomenclature through socialization and through members' overt intervention into each oth- ers' self-understanding. Both the Newport and Xtube evidence also reveals a complex social and cultural structure among members of sexual subcultures by drawing our attention to the particularity of various modes of sexual being and the relationship between those modes and particular configurations of sexual identity. In the process, this paper allows us to reassess, first, a presupposition of folksonomies as free of discipline allowing for their emancipatory potential and, second, the prevailing binary understandings of authority in the development of sexual nomenclatures and classifications as either top-down or bottom-up.",36,6,417,431,Gender studies; Sociology; Presupposition; Socialization; Sexual identity; Navy; Queer; Pornography; Human sexuality; Dominant culture; Social psychology,,,,,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/78146 https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/78146/1/ko_39_2012_6_c.pdf,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/78146,,,2116286503,,0,003-543-027-674-540; 012-652-438-359-587; 012-997-013-982-684; 017-231-206-046-780; 020-497-731-997-222; 028-064-043-010-663; 029-018-635-018-764; 035-809-334-410-365; 039-946-623-797-988; 043-495-913-746-69X; 044-094-604-229-17X; 055-317-271-594-826; 059-438-671-773-803; 064-670-699-508-566; 067-077-693-787-391; 074-220-138-428-181; 078-324-660-989-821; 078-372-125-528-210; 080-277-760-596-761; 081-044-097-710-132; 110-173-824-427-415; 118-215-443-692-382; 122-378-335-175-207; 123-669-744-776-683; 124-031-328-311-864; 124-216-270-017-531; 125-201-394-353-646; 129-250-747-093-04X; 132-412-668-018-006; 136-172-309-935-502; 144-088-996-132-047; 144-859-975-068-210; 145-186-967-934-281; 148-571-180-308-199; 149-986-647-078-739; 156-956-008-475-072; 161-577-664-521-752; 168-299-024-272-257; 174-812-603-865-761,6

Knowledge Organization, 38(2), 114-122. 35 references. ABSTRACT: While the organization and representation of information and knowledge have historically been done by profes- sionals, the rise of social media has spread the notion that this can be done more collaboratively. A more collaborative approach would entail a change in the role of professionals and in the goals and values of the systems. This paper explores the notion of authority and the role of professionals in a changing environment where more people participate in the organization and repre- sentation of information and knowledge. The paper questions the traditional role of the professionals and argues that systems must be designed to facilitate trust and authority, and that the authority of folksonomies and systems comes from the users' collective interpretations and meaning production.",38,2,114,122,Epistemology; Sociology; Cognitive work analysis; Scholarship; Knowledge organization; Associate professor; Information professional; Conceptual foundation; Social media,,,,,http://jenserikmai.info/Papers/2011_folksonomies.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-114,,10.5771/0943-7444-2011-2-114,2342060183,,0,002-735-611-123-190; 005-642-194-733-591; 007-824-275-693-413; 009-893-668-495-073; 010-313-118-780-381; 011-477-911-493-270; 013-007-727-939-750; 029-018-635-018-764; 037-539-532-930-041; 044-917-211-263-101; 053-581-260-952-157; 059-438-671-773-803; 061-698-653-620-056; 074-521-182-347-505; 077-954-762-700-03X; 080-945-058-659-719; 083-103-671-012-428; 087-831-676-456-440; 093-342-291-216-462; 110-069-106-117-420; 110-243-849-964-365; 128-057-371-140-774; 135-120-936-631-160; 137-228-565-856-56X; 140-563-581-743-828; 152-058-787-876-448; 161-752-846-263-489; 182-866-902-388-217; 183-886-660-395-952,19

Marijuán; Raquel Moral; and Jorge Navarro,"In one of the most important conceptual changes of our times, biology has definitely abandoned its mechanistic hardcore and is advancing ""fast and furious"" along the informational dimension. Biology has really become an information science; and, as such, it is also inspiring new ways of thinking and new kinds of knowledge paradigms beyond those discussed during past decades. In this regard, a new ""bioinformational"" approach to the inter-multi-disciplinary relationships among the sciences will be proposed herein: scientomics. Biologically inspired, scientomics contemplates the multifarious interactions between scientific disciplines from the ""knowledge recombination"" vantage point. In their historical expansion, the sciences would have recapitulated upon collective cognitive dynamics already realized along the evolutionary expansion of living systems, mostly by means of domain recombination processes within cellular genomes, but also occurring neurally inside the ""cerebral workspace"" of human brains and advanced mammals. Scientomics, understood as a new research field in the domain of knowledge organization, would capture the ongoing processes of scientific expansion and recombination by means of genomic inspired software (like in the new field of culturomics). It would explain the peculiar interaction maps of the sciences (scientometrics) as well as the increasing complexity of research amidst scientific and technological cumulative achievements. Beyond the polarized classical positions of reductionism and holism, scientomics could also propose new conceptual tools for scientific integration and planning, and for research management.",39,3,153,164,Epistemology; Mechanism (philosophy); Sociology; Cognition; Reductionism; Holism; Living systems; Knowledge organization; Scientometrics; Information science,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2012-3-153 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=25920381,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2012-3-153,,10.5771/0943-7444-2012-3-153,2467922858,,0,,5

Many compound classes have been removed from the main tables, and more radical revisions of classes (particularly those for Medicine and Religion) have introduced a rigorous analysis, a clearer sense of citation order, and building of compound classes according to a more logical system syntax. The faceted approach provides a means of formalizing the relationships in the classification and making them explicit for machine recognition. In the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (BC2) (which has been a source for both UDC classes mentioned above), terminologies are encoded for automatic generation of hierarchical and associative relationships. Nevertheless, difficulties are encountered in vocabulary control, and a similar phenomenon is observed in UDC. Current work has revealed differences in the vocabulary of humanities and science, notably the way in which terms in the humanities should be handled when these are semantically complex. Achieving a balance between rigour in the structure of the classification and the complexity of natural language expression remains partially unresolved at present, but provides a fertile field for further research.",37,4,270,279,Associative property; Natural language; Library classification; Information retrieval; Vocabulary; Faceted classification; Bliss Bibliographic classification; Computer science; Syntax; Rigour,,,,,http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/153366/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2010-4-270,,10.5771/0943-7444-2010-4-270,2265846087,,0,,7

165-093-106-271-191,Indexing and retrieving images in a multilingual world,2011-11-04,2011,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Elaine Ménard,"For many years, the Web became an important media for the diffusion of multilingual resources. Linguistic differences still form a major obstacle to scientific, cultural, and educational exchange. Besides this linguistic diversity, a multitude of databases and collections now contain documents in various formats, which may also adversely affect the retrieval process. This paper describes a research project aiming to verify the existing relations between two indexing approaches: traditional image indexing recommending the use of controlled vocabularies or free image indexing using uncontrolled vocabulary, and their respective performance for image retrieval, in a multilingual context. This research also compares image retrieval within two contexts: a monolingual context where the language of the query is the same as the indexing language; and a multilingual context where the language of the query is different from the indexing language. This research will indicate whether one of these indexing approaches surpasses the other, in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the image searchers. This paper presents the context and the problem statement of the research project. The experiment carried out is also described, as well as the data collection methods.",1,1,105,106,Controlled vocabulary; Data collection; Image retrieval; Natural language; Problem statement; Information retrieval; Vocabulary; Multilingualism; Computer science; Search engine indexing,,,,,http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/download/12839/11320,http://dx.doi.org/10.7152/nasko.v1i1.12839,,10.7152/nasko.v1i1.12839,2037062654,,0,013-932-222-386-140,3

Based on a close examination of the partially extant text and structure of the catalog, other historical records and secondary sources, the authors identify two principal classification methods in the scheme being studied: dichotomy and ranking. It is theorized that the compiler of the catalog, Liu Xin, used ru classicism, or Confucianism, as the principle for guiding the construction of three sets of ranked dichotomies that manifested into the six main classes in the set sequence. As a result, he successfully achieved the chief goal he intended for the catalog—to proclaim classicism as the intellectual authority. This design made the catalog, and its numerous successors in imperial China for two thousand years, an effective aid for intellectual, political, and social control.",38,1,25,42,History of China; Classicism; Sociology; Library science; Ranking; Knowledge organization; Social control; Genealogy; Dichotomy; Library catalog; Politics,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-1-25 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=24295235,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2011-1-25,,10.5771/0943-7444-2011-1-25,2464766177,,0,,10
