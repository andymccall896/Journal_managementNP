000-251-444-646-256,Electronic media and visual knowledge,,1993,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Kim H. Veltman,"The real challenge of today lies in exploring how computers will enable us to do what was not possible previously. The paper attempts to provoke thought about new frontiers of visual knowledge organization. Computers introduce the possibility of interchangeable media. They offer multiple nodes of access to a given term or object. They enable us to approach knowledge on different levels. A scheme of 10 levels is proposed and some consequences for visual knowledge at each of these levels is considered briefly. The final section of the paper considers four navigational tools: questions, maps, meters, and tracking",20,1,47,54,Navigational instrument; Human–computer interaction; Electronic media; Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Information access; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Typology,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1993-1-47 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=4925135,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1993-1-47,,10.5771/0943-7444-1993-1-47,2495233361,,0,188-563-904-203-247,1

To that end, a System Unification Model (SUM) is constructed which serves as a formal frame classifying the salient structures and functions of empirical existence. The terse presentation should give a synopsis of the scope and method of knowledge organization applicable in a global scale.; ; The methodology used is based on a Triadic Interface Paradigm which combines dialectic and syllogic algorithms to arrive at synthetic conclusions of general applications. This holistic perspective situates the static and dynamic contents of matter, energy and information systems in their space-time context. Finally, these dimensions are manipulated by formal operational codes to produce systemic and systematic knowledge.; ; The Model has been used to demonstrate a new Theory of Sociophysics which integrates the basic principles of social and natural sciences into an all-inclusive conceptual framework. Sociophysics assumes the fundamental isomorphism of nature and culture, thereby projecting heuristic metaphors between them. As a result, it contributes in enhancing, understanding and appreciating the global picture of human reality.",20,3,139,149,Scientific theory; Conceptual framework; Sociology; Artificial intelligence; Isomorphism; Heuristic; Information system; Knowledge organization; Salient; Management science; Unification,,,,,https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/983137/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1993-3-139,,10.5771/0943-7444-1993-3-139,2500907756,,0,,0

Marco; F. J. Esteban Navarro,"Intended is first of all a preliminary review of the implications that the new approaches to the theory of classification, mainly from Cognitive Psychology and Epistemology may have for information work and research. As a secondary topic the scientific relations existing among Information Science, Epistemology, and the Cognitive Sciences are discussed. Classification is seen as a central activity in all daily and scientific activities, and, of course, of knowledge organization in information services. There is a mutual implication between classification and conceptualization, as the former moves in a natural way to the latter and the best result elaborated for classification is the concept. Research in concept theory is a need for a Theory of Classification. In this direction it is of outstanding importance to integrate the achievements of natural concept formation theory (NCFT) as an alternative approach to conceptualization different from the traditional one of logicians and problem solving researchers. In clonclusion both approaches are seen as being complementary: the NCFP approach being closer to the user and the logical one being more suitable for experts, including expert systems",20,3,126,132,Epistemology; Interdisciplinarity; Sociology; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Information system; Cognitive science; Knowledge organization; Concept learning; Expert system; Conceptualization; Information science,,,,,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=3820370 http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1993-3-126,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1993-3-126,,10.5771/0943-7444-1993-3-126,2481504132,,0,,19

This lack of systematic documentation severely handicaps all historical research that involves the interpretation of iconographic detail. It leaves us unable to count the frequency with which subjects have been represented, or with which iconographic particularities occur. This article asks whether the use of the iconographic classification system ICONCLASS will help to create countable iconographic information.

These may be relevant for the electronic publication of classification systems in general.
