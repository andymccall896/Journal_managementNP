000-189-988-224-76X,Understanding the powerful grouping sense through a unifying classification theory,,1994,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,A. V. Hall,"A unifying theory has been developed that draws together a compatible set of methods for classification, and shows why others should be rejected. The methods reveal polythetic groups and sequences, and evaluate the quality and the best identifying characters for each group. The theory defines the rules for the fuzzy uses of 40 interacting options for group studies in a new 12 000 line FORTRAN program called Uniter, available from the author. The theory and the program's options help to show the nature of the achievements and failures of humanity's powerful grouping sense. This approach offers useful understandings in an extremely wide range of fields, examples of which are given. Both research and teaching should take account of this development",21,3,126,131,Automation; Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Computer program; Fortran; Humanity; Unified field theory; Fuzzy logic; Information processing,,,,,,,,,2525837012,,0,,2
003-149-126-851-754,"Onomantics and terminology. Part III : Formats, borrowed terms and omissions",,1996,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Fred W. Riggs,"Third part of a series of articles of which Pt.1 was published in KO 23(1996)No.1, p.25-33, Pt.2 in No.3, p.157-168. Pt.4 will follow in KO 24(1997)No.1. In addition to the important distinctions between the fundamental concepts and terms (tags) used in Onomantics and Terminology, as reported in the first two parts of this essay, several other interesting comparisons can be made. First, with reference to formats, both the structure and nomenclature used for terminological entries (records) in ISO 1087 parallel those found in dictionaries and suggest a semantic rather than an onomantic point of view. Second, a large number of borrowed terms taken from Lexicography and Linguistics can be found in this glossary for the terminology of Terminology. Sometimes the definitions for these terms identify them as borrowed concepts drawn from the vocabulary used by lexicographers. However, sometimes new meanings are stipulated for these terms without any markings to show that they are not borrowed concepts. Moreover, in all these cases, since the original and the newly stipulated concepts are similar, ambiguity is unavoidable. Third, some concepts that might be useful for terminologists are not included in ISO 1087: a few examples are explained. They are all concepts which lexicographers do not need and, consequently, they have no terms for them. It seems apparent that they have been omitted from the vocabulary of Terminology simply because they are new concepts without established terms. To explain the reasons for the formats, terms and omissions found in the leading glossary for the terminology of Terminology takes us into a realm of speculation that is too complicated for inclusion here, but I will discuss it in Part IV of this series, with a focus on the problems of neologisms",23,4,216,224,Epistemology; Applied linguistics; Vocabulary; Realm; Glossary; Ambiguity; Computer science; Linguistics; Speculation; Terminology; Neologism,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-4-216 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2875518,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-4-216,,10.5771/0943-7444-1996-4-216,2472096320,,0,,0

Jaenecke,"This paper is put up for discussion to help Knowledge Organization find its proper place. To begin with, a few basic concepts from the field of communication theory are defined. The new concepts permit the conclusion that what we are facing at present is not a flood of information but one of messages, and that this latter flood must not be equated indiscriminately with a knowledge flood. Messages must be judged on their contents. To this end, «knowledge» is subdivided into «core-», «peripheral», and «pseudo-knowledge», and it is argued that the great majority of scientific publications contains peripheral and pseudoknowledge. With the aid of two interlocking and self-amplying recursive mechanisms it is shown that and how pseudoknowledge is more and more gaining disciplines, hence precisely in those fields which deal with social problems in the broadest sense of the world; Thus a deficit of knowledge on which to base action is produced, leading to a general disorientation - a modern form of ignorance, keenly manifesting it self at present in a crisis of leadership. The research tasks resulting from the above for Knowledge Organization are roughly outlined",21,1,3,11,Recursion; Epistemology; Sociology; Artificial intelligence; Body of knowledge; Ignorance; Knowledge organization; Scientific literature; Communication theory; Social issues; Information science,,,,,,,,,2474834007,,0,,10

Pathak,"Attention is drawn to the inadequacies ofthe existing classification schemes as pointed out by individuals and groups concerned with classification research. The article is based on an earlier study by the author, which identified and arranged in a filiatory way the main concepts of sociology and determined their relative significance as headings in a classification scheme The sociology schedule in the Dewey Decimal Classification was examined on the basis of nine evaluation criteria, as e.g. arrangement of major categories, provision for main concepts, use of phrased headings instead of individual key terms, and scattering of related concepts in the schedule. It was found that a large number of the main concepts of sociology are either not represented in the schedule or mentioned in the scope note only along with the main headings. A table shows one hundred main concepts of sociology arranged and classified within ten major categories or sections, and their provision in the DDC. The study suggests that the DDC needs serious reconsideration with regard to the main headings/categories provided as class headings, terminology used for the concepts, the filiatory structure adopted, and the representation of the main concepts of sociology.",22,,148,158,Epistemology; Dewey Decimal Classification; Classification scheme; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Class number; Relative significance; Key terms; Computer science; Terminology; Categorization,,,,,,,,,2503470677,,0,,0

It is founded on the triplet model of concepts. 'This model depicts a concept by means of three kinds of knowledge: a concept base, a concept-representing part and the linkage between them. Informally, the concept base deals with entities subsumed under a concept and their properties and relations. The concept-representing part deals with tools and forms of representing these entities and their properties and relations in some intelligent system. The linkage deals with establishing the proper correspondences between components of the base and the representing part. Each of these knowledge kinds is associated with specific structures related to concepts (symbols, names, statements, images, texts, entities and their properties and relations, procedures of determination of property values, etc.). Various informal and formal (mainly set-theoretical) specifications of these structures serve as criteria for triplet classifications of concepts",24,3,163,175,Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Natural language processing; Property value; Computer science,,,,,https://philpapers.org/rec/KUZOTC https://philarchive.org/rec/KUZOTC,https://philpapers.org/rec/KUZOTC,,,108542390,,0,007-626-642-546-03X; 045-040-697-472-007; 047-427-333-660-313; 092-728-395-461-388; 105-401-148-815-682; 133-577-530-187-984; 152-971-415-645-665,6

One major idea to diminsh the miraculous impression was to view mathematics as exploring the vast area ofall kinds ofabstract structures, thus establishing a huge store of humanly possible thinking from which the physicist has only to choose the structure appropriate for the case before him. There remains, however, the problem of mathematical overdetermination ofphysics: the structures suitable for application usually contain mathematical elements that remain without physical interpretation.

This paper approaches the language problem from just the opposite side: the given is here a certain content; what is sought for, is an appropriate artificial language to represent this content. To this end, seven elementary representation principles are proposed. To illustrate the way they work, syntactic pattern recognition is introduced as a simple, but non-trivial example for representing knowledge in formal language. Another central thema of the paper is LEIBNIZ's characteristica universalis and the so-called LEIBNIZ project. LEIBNIZ's investigations in this field are reviewed against the background of the tasks required in syntactic pattern recognition. It is demonstrated that LEIBNIZ had, in fact, already worked with six ofthe seven representation principles proposed, further, that his characteristica universalis is an early form of a formal language, and lastly, that - contrary to the prevailing view - the LEIBNIZ project is not a matter of logic but rather one of knowledge representation, a field largely unexploited in today's logic-oriented epistemology and philosophy of science. It is precisely this one-sided orientation of these disciplines, which is responsible for the distorted picture of LEIBNIZ's work found in the literature; some typical misunderstandings are finally discussed.

The focus has so far been more on thesauri than on classification schemes. Classification schemes too could differ from one anotherin several ways : in their structural, semantic, lexical and notational features. These incompatibilities make multiple catalog search difficult for the users. The Dewey Decimal Classification is one ofthe widely used schemes worldwide that encompasses all of knowledge whereas the Mathematics Subject Classification scheme published by the American Mathematical Society is a special classification scheme that is used in several AMS publications, notably the Mathematics Review. An interface that enables mathematicians to access library collections organized with the Dewey Decimal Classification, using the AMS scheme as an interface will certainly be useful. This paper suggests a prototype expert system interface to map the MSC scheme on to the mathematics (510 schedule of DDC20 and presents the work done so far towards this end.

It progresses by association, affinity and juxtaposition of two divergent ideas in an integrative approach. To argue a case, a legal expert cannot limit himself to the perception of isolated facts, but instead must find affinities between fields expressing more cohesion in law. In this paper, it is argued that the legal specialist relies on abstract categorization to discover a precedent and thereby create a metaphorical link that serves in the argumentation stage, and also later on in the resolution of the case. On this basis, a model of case reasoning is charted that integrates a model of analogical reasoning. In the same manner, a model of analogical reasoning is designed that combines quality induction and deduction. Furthermore, it is advocated that a rich representation of a law category is required to make a good induction. Similarly, it is specified that quality induction should be constrained by abstract rules in order to preserve legal principles and compute profound similarity between cases to discover the precedent. A better grasp of analogy can help us to improve legal information retrieval as well as legal case-based reasoning",23,3,130,134,Precedent; Epistemology; Case-based reasoning; Inference; Legal case; Legal information retrieval; Computer science; Analogy; Argumentation theory; Categorization,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-130 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2506115,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-130,,10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-130,2465187902,,0,,0

Fugmann,"Traditionally, database indexing and book indexing have been looked upon as being quite distinct and have been kept apart in textbooks and teaching. The traditional borderline between both variations of indexing, however, should not conceal fundamental commonalities of the two approaches. For example, thesaurus construction and usage, quite common in databases, has hardly been encountered in book indexing so far. Database indexing, on the other hand, has hardly made use of subheadings of the syntax-displaying type, quite common in book indexing. Most database users also prefer precombining vocabulary units and reject concept analysis. However, insisting on precombining descriptors in a large database vocabulary may, in the long run, well be destructive to the quality of indexing and of the searches. A complementary approach is conceivable which provides both precombinations and analyzed subjects, both index language syntax and subheadings, and provides access to an information system via precombinations, without jeopardizing the manageability of the vocabulary. Such an approach causes considerable costs in input because it involves a great deal of intellectual work. On the other hand, much time and costs will be saved in the use of the system. In addition, such an approach would endow an information system with survival power.",24,4,205,212,World Wide Web; Bridging (networking); Information system; Information retrieval; Vocabulary; Computer science; Database index; Syntax; Search engine indexing; Formal concept analysis,,,,,,,,,2465018484,,0,,2

Symbol manipulation systems had been considered by Leibniz as a methodology of inferring knowledge in a secure and purely mechanical fashion. Such inference calculi were considered as mere artefacts which could not possibly encompass all human knowledge acquisition. In Alan Turing's work one notices a crucial shift of perspective. The abstract mathematical states of a Turing machine (a kind of calculus universalis that Leibniz was looking for) are claimed to correspond to equivalent psychological states. Artefacts are turned into faithful models of human cognition. A further step toward the Computational Theory of Mind was the physical symbol system hypothesis, contending to have found a necessary and sufficient criterion for the presence of intelligence in operative mediums. This, together with Chomsky's foundational work on linguistics, led naturally to the Computational Theory of Mind as set out by Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn. We discuss problematic aspects of this theory. Then we deal with another paradigm of the Computational Theory of Mind based on network automata.

We enumerate over two dozen way-stations, or phases, many heretofore vaguely differentiated in half a dozen academic disciplines. Each phase is illustrated with a vignette. Within that cycle, the mental awareness that one has found an anomaly is a distinct advantage, for which we propose the name of neocognition. Certain phases are especially vulnerable dead ends, choke-points, of the entire sequence. Particularly so are the 8 th to 10 th periods - the cultural reactions based on the perceived immediacy of benefit. Any requirement to obtain commercial support at this pre-development stage prevents the emergence of even farsighted latent support that could hurdle the remaining steps.

This model is different from the standard information theoretic model. It combines the understanding of cognitive information processing as an act of information generation from sense impressions with communication theoretic considerations. This approach can be of value for any system that is regarded as a knowledge system with an in-built ordering structure.

The major systems that have predominated during the twentieth century were originally predicated on the academic disciplines. This structural principle is no longer adequate because multidisciplinary knowledge production has overtaken more traditional disciplinary perspectives and produced communities of cooperation whose documents cannot be accommodated in a disciplinary structure. This paper addresses the problems the major classifications face, reports some attempts to revise these systems to accommodate multidisciplinary works more appropriately, and describes some theoretical research perspectives that attempt to reorient classification research toward the pluralistic needs of multidisciplinary knowledge creation and the perspectives of different discourse communities. Traditionally, the primary desiderata of classification systems were mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity. The need to respond to multidisciplinary research may mean that hospitality will replace mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity as the most needed and useful characteristics of classification systems in both theory and practice.",25,,1,12,Hospitality; Discourse community; Sociology; Library classification; Multidisciplinary approach; Information storage; Theoretical research; Knowledge production; Knowledge management; Discipline,,,,,,,,,2481146659,,0,,44

In terms of access, however, there are important reasons for relating content and presentation (different views, perspectives).

It foresees how such a system, linked with the equivalent of a digital reference room, will provide the basis for a System for Universal Multimedia Access (SUMMA). The latter part of the paper addresses recent developments in three-dimensional interfaces.

Riggs,"Parts I to III of this series have examined the terminology of Terminology by contrast with the vocabulary of Onomantics and identified some of the differences and difficulties revealed by a close study of ISO-1087, the most important glossary for terminologists. Part IV, finally, offers a speculative explanation of these problems. My central hypothesis is that an aversion to neologisms - especially newly coined words - impedes the introduction and acceptance of new concepts. The pressure for standardization of terminology compounds this difficulty. There are three kinds of neologisms: 1. newly coined words (neoterisms), 2. phases composed of familiar words (phrasal tags) and 3. familiar words for which new meanings have been stipulated (meta-terms). Neologisms in the form of phrases containing familiar words are often found in ISO 1087. Some perplexing ambiguities in ISO 1087 occur when new meanings are stipulated for familiar words, creating terminological metaphors (meta-terms) that are often obscure. Such meta-terms abound in the terminology of Terminology. Increased willingness to accept well-formed new words (neoterisms) would greatly simplify the development of a more adequate terminology for Terminology. The use of pleonasms is recommended as a technique to overcome ambiguity by linking familiar words having new meanings (meta-terms) to new words for the same concepts (neoterisms) and as a simple way to facilitate the introduction of such neoterisms.",24,1,8,17,Epistemology; Standardization; Willingness to accept; Vocabulary; Glossary; Ambiguity; Computer science; Linguistics; Terminology; Neologism,,,,,http://jglobal.jst.go.jp/public/20090422/200902163911370652,http://jglobal.jst.go.jp/public/20090422/200902163911370652,,,2502259138,,0,,0

This idea favors artificial intelligence research directed in studies of geometrical patterns to cognition. He hypothesizes that such patterns may be compared with geographical maps as well as topological or spatial entities present in most written languages, but especially spatially based scripts such as Chinese. A philosophical approach is employed to discuss these issues, most notably the German philosophy of Gestalt and an epistemological critique of the foundations of knowledge. He concludes such entities may provide the basis for a solid model of inteligencebase on formalized, geometricized formal patterns and that this model may be used effectively in a connectionist environment",21,3,132,139,Human intelligence; Philosophical methodology; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Schema (psychology); Cognitive science; Gestalt psychology; Computer science; Connectionism; Information processing; Information science,,,,,,,,,2463809465,,0,,0

Paradoxically the information languages increase the difficulties of cooperation between the different information databases.

After defining the notion of information compatibility, the author shows that it meets the same care of semantic coherence as the information languages themselves. Then, relying on the lessons of linguistics and automatic translating, he describes two types of viable solutions: the harmonization of several information languages (an uneasy and costly processing); and the automatic harmonization of the indexing formulas through prefabricated concordance tables, an easier solution which can however be hampered by structural discrepancies.

Maria Theresia Rolland proposes such a model in her book ,,Sprachverarbeitung durch Logotechnik (1994). Relying upon the language theory of Leo Weisgerber, she pursues a pure ,,content oriented approach, by which she understands an approach in terms of the semantics of words. Starting from the ,,implications of word-contents, she attempts to construct a complete grammar of the German language. The reviewer begins his comments with an immanent critique, calling attention to a number of serious contradictions in Rolland's concept, among them, her refusal to take syntax into account despite its undeniably real presence. In the second part of his comments, the reviewer then takes up his own semiotic language theory published in 1981, showing that semantics is but one of four semiotic dimensions of language, the other dimensions being the sigmatic, the pragmatic and the syntactic. Without taking all four dimensions into account, no theory can offer an adequate integrative language model. Indeed, without all four dimensions, one cannot even develop an adequate grammar of German sentence construction. The fourfold semiotic model discloses as well the universally valid structures of language as the intersubjective expression of human self-awareness. Only on the basis of these universal structures, it is argued, is it possible to identify the specific structures of a native-language, and that on all four levels. This position has important consequences for the problems of computer translation and the comparative study and use of languages",23,3,147,147,Epistemology; Philosophy of language; Semantics; Language model; Semiotics; Sociology; German; Grammar; Sentence; Linguistics; Syntax,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-147 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2876089,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-147,,10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-147,9018314,,0,,1

The question is analyzed to what extent this approach can be useful for multilingual thesauri, in particular regarding the functionality the thesaurus is designed to fulfil. Both the runtime use, and the construction and maintenance ofthe system is taken into consideration. Using the perspective of general language technology enables to draw on experience from a broader range of fields beyond thesaurus design itself as well as to consider the possibility of using a thesaurus as a knowledge module in various systems which process natural language. Therefore the features which thesauri and other natural-language processing systems have in common are emphasized, especially at the level of systems design and their core functionality.

While we support Nonaka's reasons for choosing a subjectivist epistemology in this managerial context, we argue that he is seriously misguided with regard to the philosophical and managerial ramifications of his choice.

This obstructive attitude can be traced throughout the centuries and manifests itself in the field of modern information science, too. An example is the allegedly necessary, inevitable precision/recall relationship, as most recently postulated again by Lancaster (1994). It is believed to be confirmed by empirical evidence, with other empirical evidence to the contrary being neglected.

Pt. 1: Their contributions to Knowledge Organization,,1996,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Fred W. Riggs,"Lexicography is the science that undergirds the preparation of dictionaries as lists of words and phrases whose meanings are defined on the basis of semantic analysis. By contrast, Onomantics reverses this paradigm : it identifies concepts that are related to each other and need to be represented as important tools in the production and organization of knowledge. Terminology bridges these two approaches : it draws heavily on the lexicographic model while moving stolidly toward an onomantic framework - from a semantic focus on the meanings of words to an onomasiological concern with the identification and representation of concepts. The article is the first of a Two Part sequence in which the basic concepts and the rationale of Onomantics are identified. They provide a framework for enhancing the ability of Terminology to contribute to Knowledge Organization. The essential logic of Onomantics as the science of concept representation is explained and its general relationship to Terminology as a growing but mixed field of applications is discussed.

Riggs,"In both Onomantics and Terminology there are about a half-dozen core concept which overlap but do not coincide with each other. They include what is called representation, description, cue, tag and notation in Onomantics and, in Terminology, definition, designation, term, symbol and name. A lexicographer writing a synonymy for such words might compare their meanings to show how they resemble or differ from each other, using a Semantic (words-to-meanings) point of view. To compare concepts (not words) in an Onomantic (Ana-Semantic, or concept-to-tag) context, one needs to compare the descriptions (definitions) of each concept to see whether they, indeed, have the same or different essential characteristics. One also needs to compare the notations that situate each concept in a system - even if the definitions of two concepts are almost the same, one might discover that because two concepts are positioned differently in their respective classification schemes, they are conceptualized differently. Finally, the concept tags (terms) used to represent each concept can also be compared semantically, i.e. to see whether their connotations and additional meanings support or hamper the unambiguous recognition of each intended concept. After an introductory display of the two sets of concepts, each of those used in Terminology is compared systematically, using all three sets of comparisons, with the nearest equivalent concepts used in Onomantics",23,3,147,168,Lexicology; Symbol; Classification scheme; Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Computer science; Linguistics; Notation; Terminology; Synonym; Lexicography,,,,,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2875506 http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-147-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-147-1,,10.5771/0943-7444-1996-3-147-1,2253456979,,0,,1

The first develops a framework for evaluating the indexing needs of the humanities with reference to four sets of contrasts: user (need)-oriented vs. document-oriented indexing; subject indexing vs. attribute indexing, scientific writing vs. humanistic writing; and topical relevance vs. logical relevance vs. evidential relevance vs. aesthetic relevance. The indexing needs of the humanities range broadly across these contrasts. The second part establishes the centrality of relationships to the communication of indexable matter and examines the advantages and disadvantages of means used for their expression in both natural languages and index languages. The use of a relational structure, such as a frame, is shown to represent perhaps the best available option. The last part illustrates where the use of relational structures in humanities indexing would help meet some of the needs previously identified. Although not a panacea, the adoption of frame-based indexing in the humanities might substantially improve the retrieval of its literature",24,2,72,83,Humanism; Humanities; Natural language; Information retrieval; Panacea (medicine); Subject indexing; Scientific writing; Computer science; Centrality; Contrast (statistics); Search engine indexing,,,,,,,,,2577600298,,0,,7

194-556-078-156-224,The classification of psychology : A case study in the classification of a knowledge field,,1998,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Birger Hjørland,"Different approaches to the classification of a knowledge field include empiristic, rationalistic, historicist, and pragmatic methods. This paper demonstrates how these different methods have been applied to the classification of psychology. An etymological approach is insufficient to define the subject matter of psychology, because other terms can be used to describe the same domain. To define the subject matter of psychology from the point of view of its formal establishment as a science and academic discipline (in Leipzig, 1879) is also insufficient because this was done in specific historical circumstances, which narrowed the subject matter to physiologically-related issues. When defining the subject area of a scientific field it is necessary to consider how different ontological and epistemological views have made their influences. A subject area and the approaches by which this subject area has been studied cannot be separated from each other without tracing their mutual historical interactions. The classification of a subject field is theory-laden and thus cannot be neutral or ahistorical. If classification research can claim to have a method that is more general than the study of the concrete developments in the single knowledge fields the key is to be found in the general epistemological theories. It is shown how basic epistemological assumptions have formed the different approaches to psychology during the 20th century. The progress in the understanding of basic philosophical questions is decisive both for the development of a knowledge field and as the point of departure of classification. The theoretical principles developed in this paper are applied in a brief analysis of some concrete classification systems, including the one used by PsycINFO / Psychological Abstracts. The role of classification in modern information retrieval is also briefly discussed.",25,4,162,201,Epistemology; Sociology; Ontology; PsycINFO; Knowledge Field; Subject matter; Scientific field; Point of departure; Historicism; Discipline,,,,,http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/105294,http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/105294,,,16262460,,0,,39
