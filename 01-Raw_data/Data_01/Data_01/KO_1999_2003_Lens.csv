Terminology organization of the activity,,2000,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Pascal Bador; Jacqueline Rey,"Following the modelling of the activity related to the completion of a pharmacy thesis, as presented in part I, we have completed the activity analysis by drawing up a structured word list to show the terminological organization around the ten operational phases. Indeed, it seemed obvious to us that the reasoning at the root of any activity is based on words used to describe it. This terminology inventory which we called Structured Terminology Environment (STE), together with the modelling diagram, could eventually be directly used during the conceiving of a software tool specific to the studied professional activity. The STE is a thesaurus of 565 words selected on the basis of a corpus stemming from five pharmacy theses and six books, where we put the significant terms which represent the actors and actions we observed during the ten phases, as well as the handled tools. Once the terms were shared out among the ten basic operations, we structured the terminology by grouping the concepts of a same nature so that the sub-categories show a certain homogeneity around the action. We used the following basic relationships: generic/specific relationships, whole/part relationships and finally, we completed the categorization with the help of classes induced by facets (process, phenomenon, properties, material or object, tool or equipment and operating conditions).",27,,44,54,Pharmacy; Information management; Artificial intelligence; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Information system; Natural language processing; Professional activity; Computer science; Operations research; Phenomenon; Terminology; Categorization,,,,,,,,,2495708169,,0,,0

Devadason; Neelawat Intaraksa; Ponprapa Patamawongjariya; Kavita Desai,"Organizing and providing access to the resources on the Internet has been a problem area in spite of the availability of sophisticated search engines and other software tools. There have been several attempts to organize the resources on the World Wide Web. Some of them have tried to use traditional library classification schemes such as the Library of Congress Classification, the Dewey Decimal Classification and others. However there is a need to assign proper subject headings to them and present them in a logical or hierarchical sequence to cater to the need for browsing. This paper attempts to describe an experimental system designed to organize and provide access to web documents using a faceted pre-coordinate indexing system based on the Deep Structure Indexing System (DSIS) derived from POPSI (Postulate based Permuted Subject Indexing) of Bhattacharyya, and the facet analysis and chain indexing system of Ranganathan. A prototype software system has been designed to create a database of records specifying Web documents according to the Dublin Core and to input a faceted subject heading according to DSIS. Synonymous terms are added to the standard terms in the heading using appropriate symbols. Once the data are entered along with a description and the URL of the web document, the record is stored in the system. More than one faceted subject heading can be assigned to a record depending on the content of the original document. The system stores the surrogates and keeps the faceted subject headings separately after establishing a link. The search is carried out on index entries derived from the faceted subject heading using the chain indexing technique. If a single term is input, the system searches for its presence in the faceted subject headings and displays the subject headings in a sorted sequence reflecting an organizing sequence. If the number of retrieved headings is too large (running into more than a page) the user has the option of entering another search term to be searched in combination. The system searches subject headings already retrieved and looks for those containing the second term. The retrieved faceted subject headings can be displayed and browsed. When the relevant subject heading is selected the system displays the records with their URLs. Using the URL, the original document on the web can be accessed. The prototype system developed in a Windows NT environment using ASP and a web server is under rigorous testing. The database and index management routines need further development.",29,2,65,77,Controlled vocabulary; Library of Congress Classification; Dewey Decimal Classification; Web server; World Wide Web; Library classification; Information retrieval; Subject indexing; Computer science; Index term; Search engine indexing,,,,,,,,,2519249569,,0,019-340-375-042-065; 025-651-247-970-399; 049-024-738-718-081; 053-421-725-922-255; 061-042-938-213-428; 070-277-249-353-807; 094-568-885-910-564; 102-669-910-571-199; 103-395-889-409-656; 150-908-378-075-688; 153-597-642-536-484; 158-560-662-702-526; 175-321-858-375-051; 182-499-359-463-219,5

Classificatory activity, however, serves different purposes in different situations. In information retrieval, the primary purpose of classification is to find knowledge that already exists, but one of the purposes of classification in other fields is to discover new knowledge. In this paper, classifications for information retrieval are called professional classifications because they are devised by people who have a professional interest in classification, and classifications for knowledge discovery are called naive classifications because they are devised by people who have no particular interest in studying classification as an end in itself. This paper compares the overall purposes and methods of these two kinds of classifications and provides a general model of the relationships between the two kinds of classificatory activity in the context of information studies. This model addresses issues of the influence of scholarly activity and communication on the creation and revision of classifications for the purposes of information retrieval and for the purposes of knowledge discovery. Further comparisons elucidate the relationships between the universality of classificatory methods and the specific purposes served by naive and professional classification systems.",30,2,64,73,Knowledge extraction; Library classification; Information retrieval; Data science; Computer science; Information science,,,,,,,,,22202072,,0,,37

031-740-156-435-499,Indexing of musical genres. An epistemological perspective,,2003,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Knut Tore Abrahamsen,"This article sets out to investigate genre as a basic criterion in subject indexing of music in libraries and bibliographical databases. The concept of genre is examined in relation to epistemology and to different values and views in both musicology and libraries. The point of departure is to regard music as a domain of actors, institutions and processes. A comprehensive definition of this domain is suggested, which includes several subdomains and discourses. The classical music subdomain and the popular music subdomain are introduced and related to libraries. The article further investigates the concept of paradigm in relation to musicology. It demonstrates how two different paradigms influence the way music is defined, described, classified and indexed and how they are part of a historical context. The fourth part of the article focuses on the concept of genre and the analysis of music and the relation between analytical methods and values/paradigms. In addition, this part focuses on the actors that are responsible for the verbalization of genres in music. The fifth part examines indexing of musical genres with a view to their function as subject access points in databases. The unsatisfactory state of today's practice, as well as the need of a better theoretical foundation of the concept of genre, is documented. The unsatisfactory differentiation in the organising of popular music is exemplified by Danish and Norwegian libraries, including the DK5 system and the Indeksering afmusik guidelines. Finally, arguments are put forward for developing an anthropological paradigm in relation to organizing music in libraries.",30,,144,169,Epistemology; Popular music; Sociology; Musicology; Subject indexing; Subject access; Linguistics; Classical music; Musical; Biomusicology; Music history,,,,,,,,,2488385637,,0,,20

It contracts the classes on Christianity, 220-280, into one class, 220, and allows for local Korean emphasis so that religions of Asian, and especially East Asian, origin are given preferred treatment. It relocates Buddhism and other religions of Asian origin into separate divisions, 230 and 240, respectively. The recommendations maintain the basic system and order of DDC. Whenever possible, they adhere to the Korean Decimal Classification in the arrangement of religions of Asian origin. Because the options for religions other than Christianity in DDC are to give preferred treatment to a specific religion, this article tries to generalize the idea to suggest an option in DDC as Option F for > 292-299 Religions other than Christianity, for other nations in the world having similar situations. It says: Contract the Bible and Christianity in 220-280 into 220, and then class other religions to give preferred treatment in 230-280, respectively, following the order in DDC. In that case, the number 2 should be inserted in the second digit of the Bible and Christianity, eg, the Bible 222, Jesus Christ & his family 223.2, and Puritanism 228.59.",28,2,75,84,Dewey Decimal Classification; Sociology; Law; Religious studies; Korean decimal classification; Asian origin; Religious diversity; Jesus christ; Christianity; Buddhism; East Asia,,,,,,,,,2527541983,,0,,3

Such is the case despite compelling evidence of the desirability and profundity of leisure in human life. This article introduces one popular form of leisure, hobbies, as a potentially provocative topic for LIS scholarship. To facilitate research on information within hobbies, the article discusses two conceptual devices: Serious leisure (Stebbins, 1982) describes essential characteristics of leisure, establishes that some types are information-rich, and provides a framework to study leisure systematically; The collectivist theory of domain analysis (Hjorland and Albrechtsen, 1995) orients research to the hobby milieu and its objective information forms, recasting them as hobby domains. As an example of the application of both devices, a case study is reviewed of the information resources in the hobby of cooking.

These three presumptions are the notion of mutually exclusive categories, teleology in the sense of linear progression toward a goal, and hierarchy both through logical division and through the dominance of some classes over others. These three presumptions are linked to classificatory thought in the western tradition. The purpose of making these connections is to investigate the cultural specificity to western culture of widespread classificatory practice.

The purpose of the medium-theory perspective is to trace the historicity of the LIS concept of knowledge organization, that is, an examination of which tradition has produced the concept. The perspective will help to reveal the condition of possibilities of knowledge organization and its strong connection with communication technologies, and their constitution of the social organization of society. The means and modes of communication fundamentally alter existing ways of thinking and of producing, communicating and organizing knowledge. The LIS concept of knowledge organization will be analyzed in relation to the storing and communication of knowledge in oral cultures, written cultures, print culture, and electronic cultures. Through this, it will be argued that the narrow LIS concept of knowledge organization is subordinated and in interaction with a broader social organization of knowledge in society. Further, it will be argued that the rise of the Internet as a source of knowledge and information must be understood in relation to and in continuation of this interaction. Among other things, it will be concluded that a relevant socio-historical background and framework for the LIS concept of knowledge organization is how humans have organized their intellectual activities throughout history in terms of particular means and modes of communication. Medium theory can provide part of this background and framework.",29,1,29,39,The Internet; Historicity (philosophy); Sociology; Organizational learning; Body of knowledge; Print culture; Knowledge organization; Knowledge management; Information and Communications Technology; Social organization,,,,,,,,,2465527463,,0,,10

The analysis indicates that different socially and historically embedded discourses on art, including pre-paradigmatic studies and scholarly paradigms, pervade knowledge organization in the art institution at three levels, respectively: 1. Art exhibitions, 2. Primary and tertiary document types (printed, audio-visual, and multimedia documents), and 3. Classification systems, bibliographies, and thesauri. The article presents three paradigms in art scholarship (iconographic, stylistic and materialistic) and analyzes in which way, and to what extent, these paradigms are integrated in the taxonomies of the LCC, DDC, UDC, and Soviet BBK classification systems. The paper also addresses the relationship among paradigms, principles for exhibiting works of art, ways of conceptualising and organizing the content in documents on art history, and LIS knowledge organization systems. It is concluded that the UDC, in particular, is well suited for representation of knowledge produced in the contexts of pre-paradigmatic, iconological, and stylistic studies. But documents by the so-called New art scholars drawing on interdisciplinary studies and representing new approaches and paradigms break with the taxonomies on art in the classical hierarchical, universal classification systems. A step towards a solution of problems caused by this break is a polyhierarchical thesaurus such as the Art & Architecture Thesaurus.",30,,128,143,Epistemology; Dewey Decimal Classification; Architecture; Sociology; Materialism; Scholarship; Knowledge organization; Exhibition; Linguistics; The arts; Art methodology,,,,,http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/2398318860,http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/2398318860,,,2415379110,,0,,30

The study analyzes the field of social work. It is aimed at developing a systematic, comprehensive, and scientifically valid knowledge map, and its applicability as an efficient tool to adequately represent knowledge in the field. The map is composed of seven parts: foundation (meta-knowledge), social worker, environment, organization, area of practice, method, and client. The study followed a qualitative four-phase research methodology. The first phase was a phenomenological analysis of the basic characteristics of social work as a social service. The analysis resulted in a seven-facet subject classification. In the second phase the conceptual skeleton was elaborated, and adjusted to the field of social work by a grounded-theory methodology. The data used for grounding the model were 14 social work resources. The model was tested in the third phase by classifying 200 terms randomly selected from the Dictionary of Social Work (Barker, 1999). Finally, in the fourth phase we classified 197 papers published in two leading journals, Social Work and Social Service Review, in three successive years, 1997, 1998, and 1999.

The history and origin of bibliographic classification [Dewey, Bliss, Mills, Beghtol] are discussed from the perspective of pragmatist philosophy and social studies of science [Kuhn, Merton, Reica]. Choices of structural principles in different schemes are found to rely on more or less implicit philosophical foundations, ranging from rationalism to pragmatism. It is further shown how the increasing application of faceted structures as basic structural principles in universal classification schemes [DDC, UDC] impose rationalistic principles and structures for knowledge organization which are not in alignment with the development of knowledge in the covered disciplines. Further evidence of rationalism in knowledge organization is the fiction/non-fiction distinction, excluding the important role of artistic resources for, in particular, humanistic research. Finally, for the analysis of appropriate bibliographic unit, it is argued that there is a need to shift towards a semiotic approach, founded on an understanding of intertextuality, rather than applying standard principles of hierarchical decomposition of documents. It is concluded that a change in classification research is needed, founded on a more historical and social understanding of knowledge.",26,3,131,139,Epistemology; Interdisciplinarity; Sociology; Social studies; Pragmatism; Rationalism; Library classification; Knowledge organization; Unit of analysis; Discipline,,,,,,,,,2473405485,,0,,34

Designers can organize bibliographies in chronological order of publication, alphabetical listing by author or title and/or subject-headings; or can follow a subject classification scheme from the relevant field. Chronological order of publication and alphabetical listings of authors and titles are the simplest ways to organize bibliographic materials, but these methods usually fail to present the thematic relations among the various items. The subject classification is the most systematic presentation, but the most complicated to develop. This study explores the subject classification model, elaborates its rationale, demonstrates an exemplary faceted subject classification scheme grounded in solid scientific foundations, and clarifies the scientific foundations of the three-phase structuring methodology that was utilized. The exemplary classificatory model is a seven-facet subject classification scheme designed for classifying scholarly papers in the field of Logotherapy. The study, in particular the scientific structuring methodology, provides an example for structuring bibliographic resources in the social sciences, as well as in other academic fields.",27,3,143,159,The Internet; Classification scheme; World Wide Web; Library classification; Information retrieval; Structuring; Faceted classification; Computer science; Logotherapy; User interface,,,,,,,,,2489681467,,0,,4

Such tools allow translators to store previously translated texts in a type of aligned bilingual database, and to recycle relevant parts of these texts when producing new translations. Currently, these tools retrieve information from the database using superficial character string matching, which often results in poor precision and recall. This paper explains how translation memory systems work, and it considers some possible ways for introducing more sophisticated information retrieval techniques into such systems by taking syntactic and semantic similarity into account. Some of the suggested techniques are inspired by those used in other areas of HLT, and some by techniques used in information science.",29,,198,203,Semantic similarity; String (computer science); Language technology; Artificial intelligence; Computer data storage; Natural language processing; Information retrieval; Translation memory; Computer science; Syntax; Precision and recall; Information science,,,,,,,,,2500400124,,0,,4

This paper describes how a multidisciplinary team attempted to integrate metadata structures from several different collections in the development of an environmental information system. The results of this qualitative study suggest that though designers and users from diverse backgrounds could conceptualize and articulate the potential new knowledge the merged system might reveal, the perceived informational value of different access points varied with disciplinary membership, and the compromises forced by this merged collection created barriers and missed opportunities for the creation of new knowledge. However, people with a variety of backgrounds were able to contribute to negotiations about metadata decisions, suggesting that this may be a key realm of translation between diverse individuals in future collaborative environments. Consequences for domain-specific knowledge organization, and for a translation and integration role for those in the field of information science, are discussed.",30,,182,190,Knowledge representation and reasoning; Information system; Domain knowledge; Vocabulary; Knowledge organization; Computer science; Knowledge management; Discipline; Metadata; Information science,,,,,https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/49413 https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/49413/1/gazan-KO03.pdf,https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/49413,,,2473154616,,0,,4

The most recent edition of DDC, with its enhanced features, has greater potential than other traditional approaches. A review of selected Web sites that use DDC to organize Web resources indicates, however, that the full potential of the DDC scheme for this purpose has not been realized. While the review found that the DDC classification structure was more effective when compared with other knowledge organization systems, we conclude that DDC needs to be further enhanced to make it more suitable for this application. As widely reported in the professional literature, OCLC has conducted research on the potential of DDC for organizing Web resources.

This objective concerns his information need. In order to achieve this objective, the user generally does some activities using the IRS. The IRS propose to the user with solutions in response to the queries formulated by the user. The main task of an IRS is to provide the user with solutions that are relevant to his information need. This is termed personalization of information. The main axe of our study is the how to personnalize the system's response according to the user's objective. We propose the use of a user model for personnailizing the system's response. In our approach, the user model defines what to represent for each user. The activities of the user during the use of an IRS is recorded based on the user model. The analysis and synthesis of these activities are used to provide the user with more relevant solutions according to his objective. Three different applications have been developed to validate our approach of personalizing the system?s response and based on an architecture that we defined for a cooperative information retrieval. The three applications are METIORE_STREEMS, METIORE_LORIA and METIORE_REVUES. METIORE_STREEMS is an IRS for managing multimedia information on trees authorized for reforestation by the European Union (EU). The project was sponsored under the EU project LEONARDO.

A critical analysis of classification schemes used in major portals and Web classified directories exposes inconsistencies in the way they classify Internet resources. The inconsistencies indicate that the developers fail to differentiate the various classificatory models, and are unaware of their different rationales. The study establishes eight classificatory models for resources available to Internet users. Internet resources can be classified by subjects, objects, applications, users, locations, reference sources, media, and languages. The first five models are content-related; namely they characterize the content of the resource. The other three models are format-related; namely they characterize the format of the resource or its technological infrastructure. The study identifies and formulates the eight classificatory models, analyzes their rationales, and discusses alternative ways to combine them in a faceted integrated classification scheme.",29,1,20,28,Classification scheme; World Wide Web; Internet resources; Internet users; Computer science; Information science,,,,,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=13933047,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=13933047,,,1485009,,0,,16

This distinction has relevance beyond Information Studies, particularly in relation to homosexual concerns. Literary criticism, in particular, frequently addresses the question: when is a work about homosexuality? This paper explores this literary debate and its implications for the design of subject access systems for gay and lesbian communities. By examining the literary criticism of Herman Melville's Billy Budd, particularly in relation to the theories of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick in The Epistemology of the Closet (1990), this paper exposes three tensions that designers of gay and lesbian classifications and vocabularies can expect to face. First is a tension between essentialist and constructivist views of homosexuality, which will affect the choice of terms, categories, and references. Second is a tension between minoritizing and universalizing perspectives on homosexuality. Third is a redefined distinction between aboutness and meaning, in which aboutness refers not to stable document content, but to the system designer's inescapable social and ideological perspectives. Designers of subject access systems can therefore expect to work in a context of intense scrutiny and persistent controversy",27,3,122,131,Epistemology; Constructivism (philosophy of education); Literary criticism; Sociology; Essentialism; Homosexuality; Closet; Aboutness; Lesbian; Queer theory,,,,,,,,,2504165042,,0,,14

Diametrically different opinions, seemingly corroborated through empirical evidence, have been presented since the time of the Cranfield experiments. Similar situations have often been encountered in the history of science if reasoning has exclusively been based on empiricism. In the information scientific field, several empirical laws have been formulated, for example that of the alledgedly inverse precision-recall relationship in information retrieval, of the assumed direct relationship between consistency and quality of indexing, and of the alledged equivalence of automatic with intellectual indexing. Empiricism is seen as only another variation of positivism, which has been abandoned in the natural sciences since the middle of this century for its evident inadequacy, but has latently survived in information science and even now dominates here. Here, it constitutes a source of continual confusion and an impediment to progress. For literally anything an empirical proof can be submitted provided that suitable examples are selected and methods are chosen. Substantial advance in Library and Information Science requires abandoning empiricism. Budd's hermeneutic phenomenology seems to constitute a promising substitute (1995).",26,1,3,9,Epistemology; Positivism; Sociology; Empirical evidence; Equivalence (measure theory); Information system; Empiricism; Search engine indexing; History of science; Information science,,,,,,,,,2522975102,,0,,5

An epistemological perspective aids in understanding the components of the taxonomic definition. Works, thus defined as entities for information retrieval, are seen to constitute sets of varying instantiations of abstract creations.

Bazerman discusses in particular the rhetoric, communicative, and epistemological issues of written knowledge. The article discusses these themes in a library and information science (LIS) perspective in terms of their implications for LIS research. For several reasons, it is argued that this way of scrutinizing into written knowledge ought to be of special interest to LIS research. As an example of a particular field of research in LIS, the article discusses the relationship between indexing theory and written knowledge. Bazerman analyzes written knowledge from a literary point of view. Among other things, it is argued that indexing theory can be seen as part of literary theory in that some of the questions raised by the latter are also raised in indexing theory. Furthermore, it is put forward that the indexer can be considered an author. The indexer produces a text, the document representation, which is the text the user actually meets in the first place. That way, the producer of a document representation is to some extent responsible for the quality of the documents indexed. Having discussed this relationship between written knowledge and LIS research in general and indexing theory in particular, it is concluded that LIS research ought to head toward more humanistic oriented research traditions, if the line of research presented by Bazerman should be considered useful for LIS.",27,4,201,212,Literary theory; Epistemology; Special Interest Group; Rhetoric; Sociology; Content analysis; Scientific writing; Linguistics; Indexer; Scientific method; Information science,,,,,,,,,2516765339,,0,,6

This is a broad field that has not been covered appropriately in knowledge organization systems such as classification schemes, thesauri, and terminology databases. The objective of the project is to improve significantly the efficiency and the quality of cross-language and cross-cultural information exchange and knowledge discovery by facilitating concept mapping and information retrieval between Western and Eastern medical traditions. Major facets of the conceptual framework include Diagnostic Categories, Therapeutic Preparations, Human Anatomy, Selected Diseases/Medical Conditions, and Basics of Traditional Systems.

132-693-568-339-041,The complementarity of natural and index language in the field of information supply: An overview of their specific capabilities and limitations,,2002,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Robert Fugmann,"Natural text phrasing is an indeterminate process and, thus, inherently lacks representational predictability. This holds true in particular in the case of general concepts and of their syntactical connectivity. Hence, natural language query phrasing and searching is an unending adventure of trial and error and, in most cases, has an unsatisfactory outcome with respect to the recall and precision ratios of the responses. Human indexing is based on knowledgeable document interpretation and aims - among other things - at introducing predictability into the representation of documents. Due to the indeterminacy of natural language text phrasing and image construction, any adequate indexing is also indeterminate in nature and therefore inherently defies any satisfactory algorithmization. But human indexing suffers from a different set of deficiencies which are absent in the processing of non-interpreted natural language. An optimally effective information system combines both types of language in such a manner that their specific strengths are preserved and their weaknesses are avoided. If the goal is a large and enduring information system for more than merely known-item searches, the expenditure for an advanced index language and its knowledgeable and careful employment is unavoidable.",29,,217,230,Language identification; Artificial intelligence; Natural language user interface; Information system; Natural language; Complementarity (molecular biology); Natural language processing; Trial and error; Computer science; Search engine indexing; Precision and recall,,,,,,,,,2465054596,,0,,3

The taggers are TnT (a statistical tagger developed at Saarland University (Brants 2000)) and WinBrill (the Windows version of the tagger initially developed by Eric Brill (1992)). Ten extracts from medical texts were submitted to the taggers and the outputs scanned manually. Results pertain to the accuracy of tagging in terms of correctly and incorrectly tagged words.

Riesthuis,"The study: Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) (Specifications fonctionnelles des notices bibliographiques) was commissioned by IFLA and published in 1998. It defines the core functions of a catalogue (and bibliographic records) as a gateway to information. For that purpose an abstract entity-relationship model of a catalogue is proposed. The FRBR model is revolutionary. The (computer) catalogue is not seen as a sequence of bibliographic records and a replica of the traditional card catalogue, but rather as a network of connected entities, enabling the user to perform seamlessly all the necessary functions. So far there has been some theoretical discussion of the model and some limited experiments, but there is a lack of research in how to implement this theoretical model in practice, in new-generation catalogues. In this paper some reactions to the model are analysed. The main focus is on consequences of the model for the OPAC interface design, particularly the searching functionality and display of results.",29,2,78,86,World Wide Web; Default gateway; Standardization; Replica; Cataloging; Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records; Computer science; S-box; Library catalog; User interface,,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2F012641e5-d9ce-41d3-972a-b63f2126d96d,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2F012641e5-d9ce-41d3-972a-b63f2126d96d,,,2096759819,,0,,6

S. Pollitt; A. O'Brien; P. A. Braekevelt,"The physical organisation of items on library shelves using any classification scheme is inevitably a compromise. The best efforts to achieve an arrangement char is helpful to users will be thwarted by the multifaceted nature of these items and the specific needs of the user and the library. Items on a particular subject will be scattered throughout the library building(s) across disciplines, by physical form, by frequency of use and whether and for how long they may be borrowed. Even though the rich information content of multifaceted items may be represented in the notation, the items required by a user will be scattered across library shelves when the item is placed in a single relative location. This paper explores these issues using examples from a University Library classified using the Dea ey Decimal Classification Scheme (DDC). The electronic context of the library OPAC can transcend the constraints imposed by the predominantly physical nature of library collections, yet the current use of classification schemes in on-line systems retains many of these limitations. Examples of such systems applying DDC on the World Wide Web are discussed and compared with a system that seeks to use DDC in what is called view-based searching. The interface and the resulting browsing and searching capability of a View-Based Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) are described. Ways in which subject. access to library collections can be improved and disciplinary scatter resolved by assigning multiple class numbers to items and exploiting the rich Dewey structure in a faceted form are discussed. It is suggested that the informative power of visual classificatory structures at the search interface will be beneficial to the broader learning experience of the user. The paper concludes that the application of classification schemes in electronic interfaces should not be bound by the physical constraints that no longer apply in an electronic context but be exploited to provide a complete, flexible and individual interface as determined by the needs of each user.",26,2,80,96,The Internet; Dewey Decimal Classification; World Wide Web; Library classification; Information retrieval; Electronic document; Computer science; Notation; Compromise; Decimal; Discipline,,,,,http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/32471/ https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/publications/the-dewey-decimal-classification-and-the-transition-from-physical,http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/32471/,,,2303947694,,0,,11

At the most superficial level notation can correspond to the hierarchical structure of the schedules or link to literal components. The notation of compound concepts can express the structure and composition of the compound, and systems exist in which symbols denote the functional roles of the constituent elements and the relationships between them. At the highest level notation can be used to mirror the actual structure of those entities which it represents, as in the case of mathematical systems or chemical compounds. Methods of displaying these structures are examined, and the practicality in a documentary context is questioned, with particular reference to recent revision work on the chemistry class of the Bliss Bibliographic Classification 2nd edition (BC2).",26,3,140,148,Artificial intelligence; Coding (social sciences); Chemistry education; Natural language processing; Bliss Bibliographic classification; Semantic relation; Computer science; Linguistics; Notation; Engineering notation; Expressivity,,,,,,,,,25330035,,0,,2

A key challenge in work centered design of classification schemes is the evolving semantics of work. This article introduces a work centered approach to the design of classification schemes, based on the framework of cognitive work analysis. We launch collaborative task situations as a new unit of analysis for capturing evolving semantic structures in work domains. An example case from a cognitive work analysis of three national film research archives illustrates the application of the framework for identifying actors' needs for a classification scheme to support collaborative knowledge integration. It is concluded that a main contribution of the new approach is support for empirical analysis and overall design of classification schemes that can serve as material interfaces for actors' negotiations and integration of knowledge perspectives during collaborative work.",30,,213,227,Semantics; Classification scheme; Domain analysis; Cognition; Negotiation; Domain knowledge; Cognitive work analysis; Computer science; Unit of analysis; Knowledge management,,,,,,,,,2491147806,,0,,14

On the one part, the relevance of a response concerns its exactness compared with the user's query, On the other part, it concerns its correspondence with the user's knowledge level and his preferences. One of the major contributions in this area of personalization of the system's response is by taking into consideration each user's specificity. We propose the use of explicit user model where the system's solution will be determined by the knowledge of the user. The user's activities are recorded as documents. The method we adopt for information retrieval combines query by criteria and information analysis. We have also proposed architecture for cooperative information retrieval. This architecture allows two users to share their experience in the process information retrieval and for the interpretation of the system's result, on distant machines. The proposals were implemented in two systems: STREEMS and METIORE. STREEMS manages information on trees while METIORE manages information on bibliographic references.",26,1,30,45,Document retrieval; Information filtering system; Concept search; Cognitive models of information retrieval; Information retrieval; Computer science; User modeling; Relevance (information retrieval); Human–computer information retrieval; Query expansion,,,,,,,,,2504535815,,0,,4

The majority of methods proposing evaluation metrics (bibliometrics and scientometrics studies) for STW rely solely on statistical data analysis methods (co-citation analysis, co-word analysis). Such methods usually work on structured databases where the units of analysis (words, keywords) are already attributed to documents by human indexers. The advent of huge amounts of unstructured textual data has rendered necessary the integration of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to first extract meaningful units from texts. We propose a method for STW which is NLP-oriented. The method not only analyses texts linguistically in order to extract terms from them, but also uses linguistic relations (syntactic variations) as the basis for clustering. Terms and variation relations are formalised as weighted di-graphs which the clustering algorithm, CPCL (Classification by Preferential Clustered Link) will seek to reduce in order to produce classes. These classes ideally represent the research topics present in the corpus. The results of the classification are subjected to validation by an expert in STW.",29,,181,197,Data mining; Artificial intelligence; Data analysis; Bibliometrics; Natural language; Information extraction; Natural language processing; Computer science; Scientometrics; Unit of analysis; Syntax; Cluster analysis,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fidelia_Ibekwe-Sanjuan/publication/228455966_From_term_variants_to_research_topics/links/0deec522041daa45e1000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fidelia_Ibekwe-Sanjuan/publication/228455966_From_term_variants_to_research_topics/links/0deec522041daa45e1000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true,,,142733533,,0,027-727-197-947-190; 030-351-458-164-924; 032-488-425-538-272; 053-648-367-593-282; 058-372-186-812-340; 082-066-790-905-433; 100-269-139-785-98X; 101-155-764-672-99X; 101-198-676-007-682; 124-140-123-350-926; 140-430-349-773-716; 144-042-338-780-241; 162-880-800-531-663; 179-269-484-598-604,11
194-391-518-246-985,Fundamentals of Knowledge organization,,2003,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,,,Birger Hjerland,"This article is organized in 10 sections: (1) Knowledge Organization (KO) is a wide interdisciplinary field, much broader than Library and Information Science (LIS). (2) Inside LIS there have been many different approaches and traditions of KO with little mutual influence. These traditions have to a large extent been defined by new technology, for which reason the theoretical integration and underpinning has not been well considered. The most important technology-driven traditions are: a) Manual indexing and classification in libraries and reference works, b) Documentation and scientific communication, c) Information storage and retrieval by computers, d) Citation based KO and e) Full text, hypertext and Internet based approaches. These traditions taken together define very much the special LIS focus on KO. For KO as a field of research it is important to establish a fruitful theoretical frame of reference for this overall field. This paper provides some suggestions. (3) One important, theoretical distinction to consider is the one between social and intellectual forms of KO. Social forms of KO are related to professional training, disciplines and social groups while intellectual organization is related to concepts and theories in the fields to be organized. (4) The social perspective includes in addition the systems of genres and documents as well as the social system of knowledge producers, knowledge intermediaries and knowledge users. (5) This social system of documents, genres and agents makes available a very complicated structure of potential subject access points (SAPs), which may be used in information retrieval (IR). The basic aim of research in KO is to develop knowledge on how to optimise this system of SAPs and its utilization in IR. (6) SAPs may be seen as signs, and their production and use may be understood from a social semiotic point of view. (7) The concept of paradigms is also helpful because different groups and interests tend to be organized according to a paradigm and to develop different criteria of relevance, and thus different criteria of likeliness in KO. (8) The basic unit in KO is the semantic relation between two concepts, and such relations are embedded in theories. (9) In classification like things are grouped together, but what is considered similar is not a trivial question. (10) The paper concludes with the considering of methods for KO. Basically the methods of any field are connected with epistemological theories. This is also the case with KO. The existing methods as described in the literature of KO fit into a classification of basic epistemological views. The debate about the methods of KO at the deepest level therefore implies an epistemological discussion.",30,2,87,111,Epistemology; Sociology; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Hypertext; Social system; Social group; Citation; Knowledge organization; Documentation; Information science,,,,,http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/catalog/21763019,http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/catalog/21763019,,,2492892086,,0,,84
