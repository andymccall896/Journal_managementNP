006-131-603-403-086,Towards a Vocabulary to Implement Culturally Relevant Relationships Between Digital Collections in Heritage Institutions,2020-04-06,2020,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Carlos Henrique Marcondes,"<p>Cultural heritage institutions are publishing their digital collections over the web as LOD. This is is a new step in the patrimonialization and curatorial processes developed by such institutions. Many of these collections are thematically superimposed and complementary. Frequently, objects in these collections present culturally relevant relationships, such as a book about a painting, or a draft or sketch of a famous painting, etc. LOD technology enables such heritage records to be interlinked, achieving interoperability and adding value to digital collections, thus empowering heritage institutions. An aim of this research is characterizing such culturally relevant relationships and organizing them in a vocabulary. Use cases or examples of relationships between objects suggested by curators or mentioned in literature and in the conceptual models as FRBR/LRM, CIDOC CRM and RiC-CM, were collected and used as examples or inspiration of cultural relevant relationships. Relationships identified are collated and compared for identifying those with the same or similar meaning, synthesized and normalized. A set of thirty-three culturally relevant relationships are identified and formalized as a LOD property vocabulary to be used by digital curators to interlink digital collections. The results presented are provisional and a starting point to be discussed, tested, and enhanced. </p>",47,2,122,137,World Wide Web; Sociology; Vocabulary; Digital collections,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-122,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-122,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-122,3015440969,,0,,0

An e-mail survey was conducted with personnel at LibraryThing, and the results were compared against tags for twenty different fiction books, collected from two different library catalogues with disparate tag cloud sizes, and LibraryThing’s web page. The data were analysed using a modified version of Golder and Huberman’s tag categories (2006). The results show that while LibraryThing claims to only remove the inherently personal tags, several other types of tags are found to have been discarded as well. Occasionally a certain type of tag is included in one book, and excluded in another. The comparison between the two tag cloud sizes suggests that the larger tag clouds provide a more pronounced picture regarding the contents of the book but at the cost of an increase in the number of tags with synonymous or redundant information.</p>",46,4,245,259,Information retrieval; Tag cloud; Computer science; Moderation,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-245,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-245,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-245,2965433880,,0,,0

To provide a foundation for research evaluation from the perspective of innovativeness, we propose an automatic approach for extracting innovative ideas from the abstracts of technology and engineering papers. The approach extracts N-grams as candidates based on part-of-speech tagging and determines whether they are novel by checking the Scopus® database to determine whether they had ever been presented previously. Moreover, we discussed the distributions of innovative ideas in different abstract structures. To improve the performance by excluding noisy N-grams, a list of stop-words and a list of research description characteristics were developed. We selected abstracts of articles published from 2011 to 2017 with the topic of semantic analysis as the experimental texts. Excluding noisy N-grams, considering the distribution of innovative ideas in abstracts, and suitably combining N-grams can effectively improve the performance of automatic innovative idea extraction. Unlike co-word and co-citation analysis, innovative-idea extraction aims to identify the differences in a paper from all previously published papers. </p>",46,3,171,186,Information retrieval; Computer science; Scopus,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-171,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-171,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-171,2955707708,,0,,0

This classification system was originally designed for musical instruments and books about instruments, and was first published in German in 1914. Hornbostel-Sachs has dominated organological discourse and practice since its creation, and this article analyses the scheme’s context, background, versions and impact. The position of Hornbostel-Sachs in the history and development of instrument classification is explored. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the mechanics of the scheme, including its decimal notation, the influential broad categories of the scheme, its warrant, and its typographical layout. The version history of the scheme is outlined and the relationships between versions is visualised, including its translations, the introduction of the electrophones category, and the Musical Instruments Museums Online (MIMO) version designed for a digital environment. The reception of Hornbostel-Sachs is analysed, and its usage, criticism and impact are all considered. As well as dominating organological research and practice for over a century, it is shown that Hornbostel-Sachs also had a significant influence on the bibliographic classification of music.",47,1,72,72,German; Library classification; Warrant; Version history; Computer science; Linguistics; Musical; Decimal; Criticism,,,,,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/22554/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-72,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-72,2971520102,,0,,0

The phenomenon of bias or discrimination in machine ethics is seen as inherited from humans, either through the use of biased data or through the semantics inherent in intellectually-built tools sourced by intelligent agents. The kind of biases observed in AI are compared with those identified in the field of knowledge organization, using religious adherents as an example of a community potentially marginalized by bias. A practical demonstration is given of apparent religious prejudice inherited from source material in a large database deployed widely in computational linguistics and automatic indexing. Methods to address the problem of bias are discussed, including the modelling of the moral process on neuroscientific understanding of brain function. The question is posed whether it is possible to model religious belief in a similar way, so that robots of the future may have both an ethical and a religious sense and themselves address the problem of prejudice. </p>",46,8,596,606,Creativity; Automation; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-596,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-596,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-596,2965597800,,0,,0

Ranganathan is credited with the introduction of the term “facet” in the field of knowledge organization towards the middle of the twentieth century. Facets have traditionally been used to organize document collections and to express complex subjects. In the digital world, they act as filters to facilitate navigation and improve retrieval. But the popularity of the term does not mean that a definitive characterization of the concept has been established. Indeed, several conceptualizations of the facet co-exist. This article provides an overview of formal and informal definitions found in the literature of knowledge organization, followed by a discussion of four common conceptualizations of the facet: process vs product, nature vs function, object vs subject and organization vs navigation. </p>",47,4,320,333,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-4-320,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-4-320,,,0,,0

Archival arrangement represents a form of bricolage that archivists have been practicing for years. By organizing records according to provenance, archivists engage in knowledge creation. Archival theory holds that records are created as an output from social and bureaucratic processes. Archival description, then, could serve as a form of archival record, bearing evidence of the processes of archival arrangement. Current participatory and community-based approaches to archival description urgently require an evidential record of their processes of community consultation and professional mediation. This paper examines two Canadian community-based, participatory archival projects. Project Naming, at Library and Archives Canada, draws upon Inuit community contributions to augment the often sparse and sometimes offensive descriptions of historic photos of arctic peoples. The Sex Work Database at the University of Manitoba, works with sex work activists to create and apply a tagging folksonomy to a collection of websites, organizational records and news media. Analysis of these diverse, community-based projects reveals how current approaches to description make it difficult to distinguish between professional and community contributions to arrangement and description, and proposes ways to make such contributions more apparent. </p>",46,7,502,521,Sociology; Knowledge organization; Knowledge creation; Community participation; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-502,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-502,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-502,3000708489,,0,,0

Smiraglia,"NARCIS—National Academic Research and Collaborations Information System-- is the national research portal for the Netherlands’ data and research archiving, which is governed by its own NARCIS Classification. The current instantiation of the classification dates from 2015. The classification is currently made up of two classes—D for the sciences broadly, and E for interdisciplinary areas. The NARCIS Classification is designed specifically and with care for the contents of the NARCIS data portal. The classification mostly represents the sciences. A few anomalous situations are visible in the ontology of the classification: the humanities occupy one division within the sciences, placed between the life sciences and law; and, the treatment of interdisciplinarity, for which a separate class E is set aside for interdisciplinary sciences. A dump of the NARCIS database was used to analyze the population of the NARCIS classification. The life sciences occupy 34% of the NARCIS database. A framework for research networking systems reveals the NARCIS database and its classification most objectives, with the only lapse being the output of entities and attributes to ontologies. The NARCIS Classification is also an occupational classification. The NARCIS classification supports a vital research portal that, in turn, supports a nationally-coordinated research effort designed to provide better inter-institutional communication of scholarly productivity, thus is in itself an information institution, in which domain-dependence is part of its cultural imperative. The NARCIS Classification incorporates an example of top-down politics in which funded disciplines are included and best represented. A perhaps unintended consequence is the encapsulation of forced views. Trajectories for further discussion with regard to continued development of the NARCIS Classification include identity, interoperability, interdisciplinarity, and synthesis.",46,5,337,344,Encapsulation (computer programming); Ontology (information science); Information system; Interoperability; Data science; Ontology; Population; Data portal; Computer science,,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.knaw.nl%3Apublications%2Faad2ccce-1ec5-4916-a07e-0ac22a604275,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-5-337,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-5-337,2969349949,,0,,1

HCFOC uses the human-centric approach, improvised with the idea of selective dissemination of information (SDI), to deal with context. Further, this ontology construction process makes use of facet analysis and an analytico-synthetic classification approach. This novel fusion contributes to the originality of HCFOC and distinguishes it from other existing ontology construction methodologies. Based on HCFOC, an ontology of the tourism domain has been designed using the Protégé-5.5.0 ontology editor. The HCFOC methodology has provided the necessary flexibility, extensibility, robustness and has facilitated the capturing of background knowledge. It models the tourism ontology in such a way that it is able to deal with the context of a tourist’s information need with precision. This is evident from the result that more than 90% of the user’s queries were successfully met. The use of domain knowledge and techniques from both library and information science and computer science has helped in the realization of the desired purpose of this ontology construction process. It is envisaged that HCFOC will have implications for ontology developers. The demonstrated tourism ontology can support any tourism information retrieval system. </p>",47,1,31,44,World Wide Web; Ontology construction; Human centric; Computer science,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-31,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-31,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-31,3018552045,,0,,0

The sociological dimension is related to GSC users who declared research interests that fall within the scope of the knowledge organization domain. The ontological dimension is based on the study of these concepts. Domain analysis was used as a methodological framework for this study. A search was conducted on GSC using keywords in order to create a list of scholars who declared the knowledge organization domain as one of their research interests in their Google Scholar Profiles (GSPs). Next, the search for GSPs of authors who had published their papers in the Knowledge Organization journal from 2000 to 2019 was conducted.

The primary challenge in the analysis of fictional content is that there is no single meaning to be analysed; the analysis is an ongoing process involving an interaction between the text produced by author, the reader and the society in which the interaction occurs. Furthermore, different audiences have specific needs to be taken into consideration. This article explores the topic of fiction knowledge organization, including both classification and indexing. It provides a broad and analytical overview of the literature as well as describing several experimental approaches and developmental projects for the analysis of fictional content. Traditional fiction indexing has been mainly based on the factual aspects of the work; this has then been expanded to handle different aspects of the fictional work. There have been attempts made to develop vocabularies for fiction indexing. All the major classification schemes use the genre and language/culture of fictional works when subdividing fictional works into subclasses. The evolution of shelf classification of fiction and the appearance of different types of digital tools have revolutionized the classification of fiction, making it possible to integrate both indexing and classification of fictional works.</p>",46,4,320,332,Information retrieval; Computer science; Search engine indexing,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-320,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-320,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-320,2965350711,,0,,0

Moeller; Kim Becnel,"<p>Through their work as instructors in a master of library science program, the authors observed a sharp increase in students’ desire to adopt the reader-interest classification approach of genrefication for their school libraries’ fiction collections. In order to better understand this trend, the researchers interviewed seven school librarians regarding their motivations for genrefying their libraries’ fiction collections; the challenges they encountered during or after the genrefication process; and any benefits they perceived as having resulted in the implementation of genrefication. The data suggest that the librarians’ interests in genrefication stem mostly from the lack of time they have to help individual students find materials, and the lack of time students are given out of the instructional day to explore the libraries’ fiction collections. The participants felt that reclassifying the library’s fiction collection by genre gave students more ownership of the fiction collection and allowed them to find materials that genuinely interested them. The significant challenges the librarians faced in the reorganization process speak to challenges regarding the ways in which librarians attempt to provide access to diverse materials for all patrons. </p>",46,3,199,208,Library science; History,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-199,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-199,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-199,2953445755,,0,,0

Some researchers consider the approaches of the two disciplinary contexts to be completely different. Others consider that, although different, they should talk to each other, as both seek to answer similar questions. With the extensive literature on this topic, we intend to contribute to the understanding of the use of the term ontology in current research and which references support this use. An exploratory study was developed with a mixed methodology and a sample collected from the Web of Science of articles published in 2018. The results show the current prevalence of computer science in studies related to ontology and also of Gruber's view suggesting ontology as kind of conceptualization, a dominant view in that field. Some researchers, particularly in the field of biomedicine, do not adhere to this dominant view but to another one that seems closer to ontological study in the philosophical context. The term ontology, in the context of information systems, appears to be consolidating with a meaning different from the original, presenting traces of the process of “metaphorization” in the transfer of the term between the two fields of study.</p>",47,3,199,219,Engineering; World Wide Web; Ontology (information science); Web of science,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-199,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-199,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-199,3041783849,,0,,0

Who is participating in this discipline’s scholarly discussion, and from what locations, both geographically and intellectually? Using the unit of authorship in the journal Knowledge Organization, where is the nexus of KO activity and what patterns of authorship can be identified? Cultural characteristics were applied as a lens to explore who is and is not participating in the international conversation about KO. World Bank GNI per capita estimates were used to compare relative wealth of countries and Hofstede’s Individualism dimension was identified as a way of understanding attributes of countries whose scholars are participating in this dialog.

A constructivist/interpretivist research paradigm was used in the study. A combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches was used to build the taxonomy. Facet analysis of disaster management, the timeframe of disaster management, and modular design were performed when designing the taxonomy. Two case studies were done to demonstrate the usefulness of the taxonomy for organizing and sharing information. The facet-based taxonomy can be used to organize online information for browsing and navigation. It can also be used to index and tag online information resources to support searching. It creates a common language for earthquake management stakeholders to share knowledge. The top three level categories of the taxonomy can be applied to the management of other types of disasters. The taxonomy has implications for earthquake online information management, knowledge management and disaster management. The approach can be used to build taxonomies for managing online information resources on other topics (including various types of time-sensitive disaster responses).

A work consists of abstract intellectual content that is distinct from any object that is its carrier. In library and information science, the importance of the work lies squarely with the problem of information retrieval. Works are mentefacts-intellectual (or mental) constructs that serve as artifacts of the cultures in which they arise. The meaning of a work is abstract at every level, from its creator’s conception of it, to its reception and inherence by its consumers. Works are a kind of informing object and are subject to the phenomenon of instantiation, or realization over time. Research has indicated a base typology of instantiation. The problem for information retrieval is to simultaneously collocate and disambiguate large sets of instantiations. Cataloging and bibliographc tradition stipulate an alphabetico-classed arrangement of works based on an authorship principle.

We explore different views during this period concerning the position of mathematics in the overall scheme of knowledge, the scope of mathematics and the internal organization of the different parts of mathematics. We examine how mathematical books were classified, from the most general level down to the level of particular subject areas in analysis.

The classification has two main sources of inspiration: Comte’s science classification and Kant’s theoretical philosophy. Peirce’s classification, like that of Comte, is hierarchically organised in that the more general and abstract sciences provide principles for the less general and more concrete sciences. However, Peirce includes and assigns a superordinate role to philosophical disciplines which analyse and provide logical, methodological and ontological principles for the specialised sciences, and which are based on everyday life experience. Moreover, Peirce recognises two main branches of specialised empirical science: the natural sciences, on the one hand, and the social sciences, the humanities and psychology on the other. While both branches share logical and methodological principles, they are based on different ontological principles in studying physical nature and the human mind and its products, respectively. Peirce’s most basic philosophical discipline, phenomenology, transforms his early engagement with Kant. Peirce’s classification of aesthetics, ethics and logic as normative sub-disciplines of philosophy relate to his philosophical pragmatism. Yet his more overarching division between theoretical (philosophical and specialised) sciences and practical sciences may be seen as problematic. Taking Peirce’s historical account of scientific developments into consideration, however, I argue that his science classification and its emphasis on the interdependencies between the sciences could be seen as sustaining and supporting interdisciplinarity and interaction across fields of research, even across the divide between theoretical and practical sciences. </p>",47,3,267,278,Epistemology; Philosophy; Classification of the sciences,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-267,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-267,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-267,3041375090,,0,,0

As social constructs of the West, the effectiveness of library KOSs is limited when it comes to organization and retrieval of non-Western knowledge materials. How can librarians respond if asked to make non-Western knowledge materials as accessible as Western materials in their libraries? The accessibility of Western and non-Western knowledge materials in libraries need not be an either-or proposition. By way of a case study, a practical way forward is presented by which librarians can use their professional agency and existing digital technologies to exercise social justice. More specifically I demonstrate the design and development of a specialized KOS that enriches digital collections with hypertext features to enhance the accessibility of non-Western knowledge materials in libraries. </p>",47,3,220,230,World Wide Web; Geography; Digital collections; Non western,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-220,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-220,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-220,3041007400,,0,,0
074-632-781-234-90X,Discipline,,2020,journal article,KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION,09437444,Nomos Verlag,,Björn Hammarfelt,"<p>“Discipline” is commonly used to denote particular areas of knowledge, research and education. Yet, the concept is often not very well defined or even explicitly discussed when used in knowledge organisation and related fields. The aim of this article is to encourage and facilitate further reflections on academic disciplines, while at the same time offering insights on how this elusive concept might be understood. An overarching argument is that “discipline” should foremost be understood in relation to institutional and organisational features, and this is what distinguishes it from related terms such as, field, domain or topic. The etymology and history of the concept are reviewed along with a discussion of attempts to define and conceptualise disciplines. Insights are offered on how disciplines might be studied. Regardless of our views of disciplines, either as inherently out-dated constructs or as important features of a well-functioning academia, it is concluded that further precision or care in explicating the concept is needed. </p>",47,3,244,256,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-244,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-244,,,0,,0

This is the rational basis of -among others- the methodology for the development of knowledge organization systems. The authority from which to select, evaluate or revise the terminology of these systems is established in relation to any of the twenty-one warrants (literary, cultural, etc.) that have been proposed and studied unequally and autonomously in the literature of the area. This paper intends to introduce initial notes and comments to advance towards an overall conception of the warrant notion. For this purpose, the expression “warrant” is studied as a word of the general language as well as a term of specialized languages. Then, the scope of application of the warrants is established. Next, each warrant is placed in one of the approaches proposed by Hjørland to categorize theories and methods (empiricism, rationalism, historicism and pragmatism). From the above, some lines of research problems are identified. A typological table that includes data on all the warrants established until now is proposed, and the first conclusions are drawn. </p>",46,8,647,655,Epistemology; History,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-647,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-647,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-647,3005977159,,0,,0

We propose a feature-level sentiment analysis framework based on rules parsing and fine-grained domain ontology for Chinese reviews. Fine-grained ontology is used to describe synonymous expressions of product features, which are reflected in word changes in online reviews. First, a semiautomatic construction method is developed by using Word2Vec for fine-grained ontology. Then, feature-level sentiment analysis that combines rules parsing and the fine-grained domain ontology is conducted to extract explicit and implicit features from product reviews. Finally, the domain sentiment dictionary and context sentiment dictionary are established to identify sentiment polarities for the extracted feature-sentiment combinations. An experiment is conducted on the basis of product reviews crawled from Chinese e-commerce websites. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. </p>",47,2,105,121,Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Ontology; Computer science; Sentiment analysis,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-105,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-105,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-105,3015223652,,0,,0

Kwaśnik,"<p>No matter how immutable a classification may seem, it is, after all, an artifact of the human imagination and functions in a particular place and time. The author describes her personal inquiry into classification as a knowledge-representation process. She traces her changing perspectives on how classifications should be viewed and evaluated by posing the following questions: 1) How does the classification process enable or constrain knowing about something or discovering something we did not already know?; 2) In what ways might we develop classifications that enhance our ability to discover meaningful information in the information stores that form a part of our scholarly as well as our everyday lives?; and 3) How might classifications mask or distort knowledge, and how might they serve to disenfranchise people and ideas? These questions are considered through a discussion of classification structures, personal classification, the link of classification to theory, everyday working classifications, translation of classifications, cognitive aspects, browsing, genres, warrant, and the difficulties of navigating complex ontological commitments. The through thread is the importance of context, because classifications can only be seen with respect to the human endeavors that generate them. </p>",46,8,656,667,Knowledge representation and reasoning; Information retrieval; Computer science,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-656,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-656,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-656,3006660576,,0,,0

He can be read for well-informed critiques of the instruments by which writings are organized for retrieval-the bibliographical side of KO. He can also be read for shrewd accounts of personal knowledge and behavior with respect to societal information systems-the social-epistemological side of KO. Indeed, in his work the two sides converge. One of his themes is the preferability of human consultants over bibliographies and catalogs for answering questions. He thus writes at length about the social organization of possible consultants and their degrees of cognitive authority in communicating what they know. Another theme is the desirability of indexing writings not only by subject but also by their possible utility in helping individuals. For that, however, he saw little hope. A third theme is ideal information systems. Broadly, he can be read for his clarifications of concepts on both sides of KO, such as bibliographical control, relevance, subject indeterminacy, information needs, information overload, librarians’ roles, and LIS as a field.</p>",46,4,279,307,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-279,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-4-279,,,0,,0

Tennis,"Aboutness ranks amongst our field’s greatest bugbears. What is a work about? How can this be known? This mirrors debates within the philosophy of language, where the concept of representation has similarly evaded satisfactory definition. This paper proposes that we abandon the strong sense of the word aboutness, which seems to promise some inherent relationship between work and subject, or between word and world. Instead, we seek an etymological reset to the sense of aboutness of “in the vicinity, nearby; in some place or various places nearby; all over a surface.” To distinguish this sense, we introduce the term episemantics. The authors have each independently applied this term in slightly different contexts and scales (Hauser 2018a; J. T. Tennis 2016), and this article presents a unified definition of the term and guidelines for applying it at the scale of both words and works. The resulting weak concept of aboutness is pragmatic, in Star’s sense of a focus on consequences over antecedents, while reserving space for the critique and improvement of aboutness determinations within various contexts and research programs. The paper finishes with a discussion of the implication of the concept of episemantics and methodological possibilities it offers for knowledge organization research and practice.",7,1,27,34,Epistemology; Philosophy of language; Sociology; Knowledge organization; Aboutness,,,,,https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/download/15617/12999 https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/view/15617,https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/view/15617,,,2979060297,,0,,0

In the preliminary results, we have defined instance-based and schema-based categories of semantic enrichment. In the instance-based category, in which enrichment occurs by enhancing the content of entities, we further determined three types, including: 1) enriching the entities by linking to diverse external resources in order to provide additional data of multiple perspectives; 2) enriching the entities with missing data, which is needed to satisfy the semantic queries; and, 3) providing the entities with access to an extended knowledge base. In the schema-based categories that enrichment occurs by enhancing the relations between the properties, we have identified two types, including: 1) enriching the properties by defining the hierarchical relations between properties; and, 2) specifying properties’ domain and range for data reasoning. In addition, the study implements the LOD dataset in a digital humanities platform to demonstrate how instances and entities can be applied in the full texts where the relationship between entities are highlighted in order to bring scholars more semantic details of the texts. </p>",46,8,607,614,History of China; Ancient history; History,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-607,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-607,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-607,2964691822,,0,,0

Focusing on studies which adopt a user-centred approach, the review presents a survey of the methodologies and results from empirical studies undertaken on the use of thesauri as sources of term selection for query formulation and expansion during the search process. It summaries the ways in which domain-specific thesauri from different disciplines have been used by various types of users and how these tools aid users in the selection of search terms. The review consists of two main sections covering, firstly studies on thesaurus-aided search term selection and secondly those dealing with query expansion using thesauri. Both sections are illustrated with case studies that have adopted a user-centred approach.",29,1,1,19,Empirical research; World Wide Web; Information retrieval; Query formulation; Computer software; Web searching; Search terms; Computer science; Search engine; Query expansion,,,,,https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/2614/ https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/thesaurus-assisted-search-term-selection-and-query-expansion-a-re,https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/2614/,,,59447548,,0,003-149-161-797-749; 004-596-003-512-606; 006-259-104-409-89X; 007-045-604-679-821; 007-734-995-401-950; 008-141-770-239-254; 008-771-984-636-681; 009-662-265-360-918; 011-148-244-026-910; 013-206-584-796-095; 014-027-121-521-784; 014-136-049-745-929; 017-121-471-611-237; 017-405-479-023-012; 020-862-675-584-767; 022-534-019-537-989; 023-824-700-442-501; 025-687-251-131-111; 028-708-997-357-79X; 028-816-003-477-815; 031-709-902-427-584; 031-874-472-602-694; 032-482-516-959-542; 034-556-094-198-342; 035-095-098-774-156; 035-821-383-604-74X; 039-024-622-097-364; 042-712-687-087-877; 043-404-190-080-217; 048-656-419-933-058; 049-932-768-344-985; 050-405-703-120-922; 052-593-254-937-470; 056-151-556-881-799; 058-089-490-297-255; 058-904-662-043-541; 061-845-821-362-760; 064-982-870-800-835; 076-016-435-072-534; 079-450-582-989-60X; 079-731-870-696-183; 079-750-479-692-60X; 080-769-542-738-929; 090-627-891-494-976; 095-857-199-263-851; 099-734-413-327-891; 102-335-301-642-166; 102-354-551-895-91X; 104-073-156-250-646; 105-430-386-590-610; 118-008-789-854-447; 121-915-649-770-564; 122-637-826-384-20X; 136-652-744-655-006; 138-034-025-791-17X; 142-165-658-975-66X; 144-688-030-684-133; 144-967-231-445-157; 145-050-691-202-414; 153-124-321-430-304; 153-948-338-297-249; 155-576-617-729-815; 157-949-224-337-759; 178-257-231-553-243; 180-908-800-746-247,4

It is information science’s role to be vigilant in perpetuating seditious discourses which end up reaffirming offenses, prejudices and humiliations to certain groups of people, especially those labeled as marginalized, that is, who are not part of the dominant group holding social power. In the quest for this diversity, this study reviews the literature of the area on how thesauri can become more inclusive and on the role of semantic warrant, specific to the philosophical, literary and cultural warrant. This research highlights the need to review thesaurus construction models so that they can be more open and inclusive to the cultural diversity of today’s society, formed by social actors who claim their spaces and representations. To this end, guidelines are suggested for the construction of thesauri procedures that allow cultural warrant receptivity. </p>",46,8,639,646,Cultural diversity; Sociology; Knowledge organization; Social perspective; Public relations,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-639,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-639,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-639,3005603996,,0,,0

Smiraglia,"Research information can be useful to science stakeholders for discovering, evaluating and planning research activities. In the Netherlands, the institute tasked with the stewardship of national research information is DANS (Data Archiving and Networked Services). DANS is the home of NARCIS, the national portal for research information, which uses a similarly named national research classification. The NARCIS Classification assigns symbols to represent the knowledge-bases of contributing scholars. A recent research stream in knowledge organization known as comparative classification uses two or more classifications experimentally to generate empirical evidence about coverage of conceptual content, population of the classes, and economy of classification. This paper builds on that research in order to further understand the comparative impact of the NARCIS Classification alongside a classification designed specifically for information resources. Our six cases come from the DANS project Knowledge Organi- zation System Observatory (KOSo), which itself is classified using the Information Coding Classification (ICC) created in 1982 by Ingetraut Dahlberg. ICC is considered to have the merits of universality, faceting, and a top-down approach. Results are exploratory, indicating that both classifications provide fairly precise coverage. The inflexibility of the NARCIS Classification makes it difficult to express complex concepts. The meta-ontological, epistemic stance of the ICC is apparent in all aspects of this study. Using the two together in the DANS KOS Observatory will provide users with both clarity of scientific positioning and ontological relativity.",46,5,345,353,Empirical evidence; Interoperability; Data science; Ontology; CLARITY; Knowledge organization; Population; Research information; Conceptual content; Computer science,,,,,https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/en/publications/toward-better-interoperability-of-the-narcis-classification https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.knaw.nl%3Apublications%2F107833bc-3822-4a43-8dfa-8f19af09e936,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-5-345,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-5-345,2969452748,,0,,1

Glushko,"<p>The organization of musical resources in a piece of music is opaque for everyone but for those with the highest levels of musical education. For the average listener, the specific vocabulary of musical organization is usually replaced by metaphorical language relating to inspiration and musical affect, or by a social perspective that rids the music of its specific theoretical language and provides a more relatable perspective of the music as a historical and communal event. We examine the ways in which information architecture and organizational theory can surface the inner workings of music in a relatable and approachable way. We consider music as a series of design resources that composers draw upon and organize according to a series of constraints that create a sense of musical structure to which the listener can relate. After a general introduction to the literature relating to constraints and creativity, we use two historical anecdotes that provide accessible demonstrations of how musicians in the seventeenth and twentieth centuries organized their musical resources both for their own compositional needs and for the purposes of didactic communication. </p>",46,3,161,170,Information architecture; Sociology; Cognitive science; Musical,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-161,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-161,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-3-161,2954172856,,0,,0

Since then, provenance and document context have supported the organization of archival knowledge (especially through classification and description procedures). Such relationships were gradually refined over the years and from different experiences between European archives and their classification and ordering systems. Historically, the principle of provenance is a pivotal moment in the development of archival theory, crucial to understanding the nature of records and archives. However, in archival theory, the principle of provenance still does not correspond to a single term or a single definition and scarce normalization terminology remains one of the problems of archival science, which leads to a lack of consensus about the division between the two principles of provenance and original order. Recently, the concept of provenance has been addressed by many other disciplines (law, library and information science, computer science and visual analytics) and applied to different domains (cloud-based storage, preservation of digital records, digital evidence, digital humanities, e-science, open data, linked data, knowledge organization and indexing. As the use of provenance reaches new domains it is no longer just an organizing principle but also a means of reaching for authenticity and reliability of data and objects in digital environments or museums or to reestablish the original organic relationship in library collections. </p>",46,7,558,568,Knowledge organization; Provenance; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-558,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-558,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-558,3000020279,,0,,0

There is a gap in the archival area regarding the expression representation of information from the description of the nineteenth century. As for the theoretical-methodological aspect, there was a theoretical survey of the representation of information in publications in the interdisciplinary areas; as to the operational methodology, questionnaires were applied to information agencies on the use of controlled vocabularies, in relation to the treatment of information in archival collections.

The study was conducted in two stages: i) literature identification, where the systematic literature review methodology was employed; and, ii) ontological review, where the parametric approach was applied. The study resulted in a set of fourteen papers discussing the flood ontology (FO). The ontological review revealed that most of the flood ontologies were task ontologies, formal, modular, and used web ontology language (OWL) for their representation. The most (re)used ontologies were SWEET, SSN, Time, and Space. METHONTOLOGY was the preferred design methodology, and for evaluation, application-based or data-based approaches were preferred. The majority of the ontologies were built around the response phase of the disaster. The unavailability of the full ontologies somewhat restricted the current study as the structural ontology metrics are missing. But the scientific community, the developers, of flood disaster management systems can refer to this work for their research to see what is available in the literature on flood ontology and the other major domains essential in building the FO. </p>",47,2,138,159,Parametric statistics; Data mining; Ontology (information science); Computer science; Flood myth,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-138,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-138,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-2-138,3015240837,,0,,0

The aim is to systematize the relations between knowledge organization and archival science within the scope of classification and description. Bibliographic research in ISKO literature and archival literature was performed. Through systematization, it was possible to understand how the relationship between these fields is carried out and how it can be strengthened. The field of knowledge organization makes a pivotal contribution to the development of methodologies to access information. A series of developments in languages, structures and classifications, that is, knowledge organization systems (KOSs), is presented. On the other hand, archival science has been developing simultaneously, but in many moments seeking interlocutions, although superficial or even unintentional with the field of knowledge organization. The approximation of these fields is essential for the development of archival classification and description, aiming for the construction of ontologies, taxonomies and controlled vocabularies among others. These recent approximations must have occurred due to the changes that have happened in the last twenty years in relation to records management and the way people build knowledge and seek information. Also, it is possible to apply KOSs in the administrative digital environment for better archival representation instruments.  </p>",46,7,493,501,Sociology; Knowledge organization; Archival science; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-493,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-493,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-493,2998779352,,0,,0

The domain that has been chosen is human nervous system (HNS) disorders. It is hypothesized here that an ontology-based patient records management system is more effective in meeting and addressing complex information needs of health-care personnel. Therefore, this study has been based on the premise that developing an ontology and using it as a component of the search interface in hospital records management systems will lead to more efficient and effective management of health-care. It is proposed here to develop an ontology of the domain of HNS disorders using a standard vocabulary such as MeSH or SNOMED CT. The principal classes of an ontology include facet analysis for arranging concepts based on their common characteristics to build mutually exclusive classes. We combine faceted theory with description logic, which helps us to better query and retrieve data by implementing an ontological model. Protégé 5.2.0 was used as ontology editor. The use of ontologies for domain modelling will be of acute help to doctors for searching patient records. In this paper we show how the faceted approach helps us to build a flexible model and retrieve better information.

Diverse UGC sources and information overload are making it increasingly difficult to satisfy personalized information needs. To organize UGCs in a user-centered way, we should not only map them based on textual topics but also link them with users and even user communities. We propose a multi-dimensional framework to organize information by connecting UGCs, users, and user communities. First, we use a topic model to generate a topic hierarchy from UGCs. Second, an author-topic model is applied to learn user interests. Third, user communities are detected through a label propagation algorithm. Finally, a multi-dimensional information organization pattern is formulated based on similarities among the topic hierarchies of UGCs, user interests, and user communities. The results reveal that: 1) our proposed framework can organize information from multiple sources in a user-centered way; 2) hierarchical topic structures can provide comprehensive and in-depth topics for users; and, 3) user communities are efficient in helping people to connect with others who have similar interests.</p>",46,2,90,103,World Wide Web; Computer science; Social network,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-2-90,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-2-90,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-2-90,2945967975,,0,,0
145-162-485-543-214,Episemantics: Aboutness as Aroundness,,2019,journal article,KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION,09437444,Nomos Verlag,Germany,Elliott Hauser; Joseph T. Tennis,"<p>Aboutness ranks amongst our field’s greatest bugbears. What is a work about? How can this be known? This mirrors debates within the philosophy of language, where the concept of representation has similarly evaded satisfactory definition. This paper proposes that we abandon the strong sense of the word aboutness, which seems to promise some inherent relationship between work and subject, or, in philosophical terms, between word and world. Instead, we seek an etymological reset to the older sense of aboutness as “in the vicinity, nearby; in some place or various places nearby; all over a surface.” To distinguish this sense in the context of information studies, we introduce the term episemantics. The authors have each independently applied this term in slightly different contexts and scales (Hauser 2018a; Tennis 2016), and this article presents a unified definition of the term and guidelines for applying it at the scale of both words and works. The resulting weak concept of aboutness is pragmatic, in Star’s sense of a focus on consequences over antecedents, while reserving space for the critique and improvement of aboutness determinations within various contexts and research programs. The paper finishes with a discussion of the implication of the concept of episemantics and methodological possibilities it offers for knowledge organization research and practice. We draw inspiration from Melvil Dewey’s use of physical aroundness in his first classification system and ask how aroundness might be more effectively operationalized in digital environments. </p>",46,8,590,595,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-590,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-8-590,,,0,,0

152-347-604-820-830,The Basic Concepts Classification (BCC),2020-07-09,2020,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Rick Szostak,"<p>The Basics Concept Classification (BCC) is a “universal” scheme: it attempts to encompass all areas of human understanding. Whereas most universal schemes are organized around scholarly disciplines, the BCC is instead organized around phenomena (things), the relationships that exist among phenomena, and the properties that phenomena and relators may possess. This structure allows the BCC to apply facet analysis without requiring the use of “facet indicators.” The main motivation for the BCC was a recognition that existing classifications that are organized around disciplines serve interdisciplinary scholarship poorly. Complex concepts that might be understood quite differently across groups and individuals can generally be broken into basic concepts for which there is enough shared understanding for the purposes of classification. Documents, ideas, and objects are classified synthetically by combining entries from the schedules of phenomena, relators, and properties. The inclusion of separate schedules of-generally verb-like-relators is one of the most unusual aspects of the BCC. This (and the schedules of properties that serve as adjectives or adverbs) allows the production of sentence-like subject strings. Documents can then be classified in terms of the main arguments made in the document. BCC provides very precise descriptors of documents by combining phenomena, relators, and properties synthetically. The terminology employed in the BCC reduces terminological ambiguity. The BCC is still being developed and it needs to be fleshed out in certain respects. Yet it also needs to be applied; only in application can the feasibility and desirability of the classification be adequately assessed. </p>",47,3,231,243,Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Computer science,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-231,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-231,,10.5771/0943-7444-2020-3-231,3041961779,,0,,0

173-877-453-721-519,Semantic Enrichment of Linked Archival Materials,,2019,journal article,Knowledge Organization,09437444,International Society for Knowledge Organization,Germany,Shu-Jiun Chen,"<p>By using the metadata for the fonds of “Chen Cheng-po’s Paintings and Documents” (CCP) in the database of the Archives of the Institute of Taiwan History (IHT, Academia Sinica, Taiwan), we develop and enhance a semantic data model for converting the data into a linked data project, focusing on data modeling, data reconciliation, and data enrichment. The research questions are: 1) How can we keep the original rich and contextual information of the archival materials during a LOD task?; 2) How can we integrate heterogeneous datasets about the same real-world resources from libraries, archives, and museums, while keeping the different views distinct?; and, (3) How can we provide added value for semantic metadata of archives in terms of instance-based and schema-based types of enrichment? The project adopts the Europeana Data Model (EDM) as the main model and extends the properties to fit the contextual characteristics of archival materials. Various methods are explored to preserve the hierarchical structure and context of the archival materials, to enrich semantic data, and to connect data from different sources and institutions. We propose four approaches to enriching data semantics by: 1) directly using external vocabularies; 2) reconciling local links to other linked data sources; 3) introducing contextual classes for the appropriate contextual entities; and, 4) utilizing named entity extraction. The results can contribute to the best practice for developing linked data for art-related archival materials. </p>",46,7,530,547,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-530,http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-530,,10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-530,2999898336,,0,,0

Given its inherent interdisciplinarity, we ask what might a map of the physical, cultural and intellectual geography of the KO community look like? Who is participating in this discipline’s scholarly discussion, and from what locations, both geographically and intellectually? Using the unit of authorship in the journal Knowledge Organization, where is the nexus of KO activity, and what patterns of authorship can be identified? What indices can be generated to describe the KO community of researchers as it has evolved? Cultural characteristics were applied as a lens to explore who is and is not participating in the international conversation about KO. World Bank GNI per capita estimates were used to compare relative wealth of countries and Hofstede’s Individualism dimension was identified as a way of understanding attributes of countries whose scholars are participating in this dialog. Descriptive statistics were generated through Excel, and data visualizations were rendered through Tableau Public and TagCrowd. The current project offers one method for examining an international and interdisciplinary field of study, but also suggests potential for analyzing other interdisciplinary areas within the larger discipline of information science.",7,1,94,111,Epistemology; Interdisciplinarity; Sociology; Nexus (standard); Dialog box; Conversation; Knowledge organization; Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory; Discipline; Information science,,,,,https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/view/15627 https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/download/15627/13009,https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/nasko/article/view/15627,,,2972826689,,0,,0
