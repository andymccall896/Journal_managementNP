0,0hello,194-391-518-246-985,0,"This article is organized in 10 sections: (1) Knowledge Organization (KO) is a wide interdisciplinary field, much broader than Library and Information Science (LIS). (2) Inside LIS there have been many different approaches and traditions of KO with little mutual influence. These traditions have to a large extent been defined by new technology, for which reason the theoretical integration and underpinning has not been well considered. The most important technology-driven traditions are: a) Manual indexing and classification in libraries and reference works, b) Documentation and scientific communication, c) Information storage and retrieval by computers, d) Citation based KO and e) Full text, hypertext and Internet based approaches. These traditions taken together define very much the special LIS focus on KO. For KO as a field of research it is important to establish a fruitful theoretical frame of reference for this overall field. This paper provides some suggestions. (3) One important, theoretical distinction to consider is the one between social and intellectual forms of KO. Social forms of KO are related to professional training, disciplines and social groups while intellectual organization is related to concepts and theories in the fields to be organized. (4) The social perspective includes in addition the systems of genres and documents as well as the social system of knowledge producers, knowledge intermediaries and knowledge users. (5) This social system of documents, genres and agents makes available a very complicated structure of potential subject access points (SAPs), which may be used in information retrieval (IR). The basic aim of research in KO is to develop knowledge on how to optimise this system of SAPs and its utilization in IR. (6) SAPs may be seen as signs, and their production and use may be understood from a social semiotic point of view. (7) The concept of paradigms is also helpful because different groups and interests tend to be organized according to a paradigm and to develop different criteria of relevance, and thus different criteria of likeliness in KO. (8) The basic unit in KO is the semantic relation between two concepts, and such relations are embedded in theories. (9) In classification like things are grouped together, but what is considered similar is not a trivial question. (10) The paper concludes with the considering of methods for KO. Basically the methods of any field are connected with epistemological theories. This is also the case with KO. The existing methods as described in the literature of KO fit into a classification of basic epistemological views. The debate about the methods of KO at the deepest level therefore implies an epistemological discussion.",097-421-372-053-520,"This paper discusses some problems encountered in hypermedia-based collaboration and reuse, and presents a conceptual framework to resolve these problems. Three suggestions are made based on the discussion: 1) extra organizational structures are necessary in shared hypermedia to support collaborative interactions; 2) an abstract schema is a key to capture the dynamic nature of the shared hypermedia; 3) an integration of the schema evolution approach and the workflow approach is recommended for an open system hypermedia teamwork support. The whole authoring environment is divided into several component spaces with particular respect to the Dexter Hypertext Reference Model. Not only can this separation reduce the overall complexity of working within such an environment, but it also conforms more closely with human cognitive needs in collaborative authoring and reuse acitivites",,,

Therefore, a definition of the concept of Representation of knowledge is indispensable. The term representation has been used in western cultural and intellectual tradition to refer to the diverse ways that a subject comprehends an object. Representation is a process which requires the structure of natural language and human memory whereby it is interwoven in a subject and in conscience. However, at the present time, the term Representation of knowledge is applied to the processing of electronic information, combined with the aim of emulating the human mind in such a way that one has endeavoured to transfer, with great difficulty, the complex structurality of the conceptual representation of human knowledge to new digital information technologies. Thus, nowadays, representation of knowledge has taken on diverse meanings and it has focussed, for the moment, on certain structures and conceptual hierarchies which carry and transfer information, and has initially been based on the current representation of knowledge using artificial intelligence. The traditional languages of documentation, also referred to as languages of representation, offer a structured representation of conceptual fields, symbols and terms of natural and notational language, and they are the pillars for the necessary correspondence between the object or text and its representation. These correspondences, connections and symbolisations will be established within the electronic framework by means of different models and of the goal domain, which will give rise to organisations, structures, maps, networks and levels, as new electronic documents are not compact units but segments of information. Thus, the new representation of knowledge refers to data, images, figures and symbolised, treated, processed and structured ideas which replace or refer to documents within the framework of technical processing and the recuperation of electronic information.",061-018-838-320-648,"Claudio Gnoli has been working as an academic librarian since 1994.

Gnoli, Claudio. Metadata About What? Distinguishing Between Ontic, Epistemic, and Documental Dimensions in Knowledge Organization. Knowledge Organization. 39(4), 268-275. 37 references. ABSTRACT: The spread of many new media and formats is changing the scenario faced by knowledge organizers: as printed monographs are not the only standard form of knowledge carrier anymore, the traditional kind of knowl- edge organization (KO) systems based on academic disciplines is put into question. A sounder foundation can be provided by an analysis of the different dimensions concurring to form the content of any knowledge item—what Brian Vickery described as the steps ""from the world to the classifier."" The ultimate referents of documents are the phenomena of the real world, that can be ordered by ontology, the study of what exists. Phenomena coexist in subjects with the perspectives by which they are considered, pertaining to epistemology, and with the formal features of knowledge carriers, adding a further, pragmatic layer. All these di- mensions can be accounted for in metadata, but are often done so in mixed ways, making indexes less rigorous and interoperable. For example, while facet analysis was originally developed for subject indexing, many ""faceted"" interfaces today mix subject fac- ets with form facets, and schemes presented as ""ontologies"" for the ""semantic Web"" also code for non-semantic information. In bibliographic classifications, phenomena are often confused with the disciplines dealing with them, the latter being assumed to be the most useful starting point, for users will have either one or another perspective. A general citation order of dimensions— phenomena, perspective, carrier—is recommended, helping to concentrate most relevant information at the beginning of head- ings.",,,

Some researchers, particularly in the field of biomedicine, do not adhere to this dominant view but to another one that seems closer to ontological study in the philosophical context.

The classification has two main sources of inspiration: Comte’s science classification and Kant’s theoretical philosophy. Peirce’s classification, like that of Comte, is hierarchically organised in that the more general and abstract sciences provide principles for the less general and more concrete sciences. However, Peirce includes and assigns a superordinate role to philosophical disciplines which analyse and provide logical, methodological and ontological principles for the specialised sciences, and which are based on everyday life experience. Moreover, Peirce recognises two main branches of specialised empirical science: the natural sciences, on the one hand, and the social sciences, the humanities and psychology on the other. While both branches share logical and methodological principles, they are based on different ontological principles in studying physical nature and the human mind and its products, respectively. Peirce’s most basic philosophical discipline, phenomenology, transforms his early engagement with Kant. Peirce’s classification of aesthetics, ethics and logic as normative sub-disciplines of philosophy relate to his philosophical pragmatism. Yet his more overarching division between theoretical (philosophical and specialised) sciences and practical sciences may be seen as problematic. Taking Peirce’s historical account of scientific developments into consideration, however, I argue that his science classification and its emphasis on the interdependencies between the sciences could be seen as sustaining and supporting interdisciplinarity and interaction across fields of research, even across the divide between theoretical and practical sciences. </p>",,,
11,11hello,105-100-051-441-427,11,"The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate that the mechanisms of power around classifications of gender and sexuality are not always top-down or bottom-up. Instead, the weight of social discipline among members of sexual subcultures themselves helps to create these classifications, often reflecting the nomenclature of subjects and desires within sexual subcultures in a complex relationship to a dominant culture. Critically examining two benchmarks in the development of sexual nomenclature within queer subcultures, this paper finds its evidence in George Chauncey's little known analysis (1985) of a navy investigation of male homosexuality at the Newport Naval Training Station during the World War I era and in contemporary folksonomic classifi- cations of representations of queer desire within Xtube, a database of online pornography. Social discipline within these sexual sub- cultures occurs in the stabilization of nomenclature through socialization and through members' overt intervention into each oth- ers' self-understanding. Both the Newport and Xtube evidence also reveals a complex social and cultural structure among members of sexual subcultures by drawing our attention to the particularity of various modes of sexual being and the relationship between those modes and particular configurations of sexual identity. In the process, this paper allows us to reassess, first, a presupposition of folksonomies as free of discipline allowing for their emancipatory potential and, second, the prevailing binary understandings of authority in the development of sexual nomenclatures and classifications as either top-down or bottom-up.",027-396-266-532-738,"Claudio Gnoli has been working as an academic librarian since 1994.

Gnoli, Claudio. Classification Transcends Library Business. Knowledge Organization, 37(3), 223-229. 26 references. Abstract: Although bibliographic classifications usually adopt a perspective different from that of object classifications, the two have obvious relationships. These become especially relevant when users are looking for knowledge scattered in a wide va- riety of forms and media. This is an increasingly common situation, as library catalogues now coexist in the global digital envi- ronment with catalogues of archives, of museums, of commercial products, and many other information resources. In order to make the subject content of all these resources searchable, a broader conception of classification is needed, that can be applied to any knowledge item, rather than only bibliographic materials. To illustrate this we take an example of the research on bag- pipes in Northern Italian folklore. For this kind of research, the most effective search strategy is a cross-media one, looking for many different knowledge sources such as published documents, police archives, painting details, museum specimens, organi- zations devoted to related subjects. To provide satisfying results for this kind of search, the traditional disciplinary approach to classification is not sufficient. Tools are needed in which knowledge items dealing with a phenomenon of interest can be re- trieved independently from the other topics with which it is combined, the disciplinary context, and the medium where it oc- curs. This can be made possible if the basic units of classification are taken to be the phenomena treated, as recommended in the Leon Manifesto, rather than disciplines or other aspect features. The concept of bagpipes should be retrievable and browsable in any combination with other phenomena, disciplines, media etc. Examples are given of information sources that could be managed by this freely-faceted technique of classification.",,,

Five judges identified examples of strong/hesitant forward-looking sentiment that were used to compare the KOS developed in the study to existing models. The 'composite' KOS was subsequently applied to annual company reports to generate word frequency and biologically inspired diversity ratios. Critical realism was used as a philosophy to interpret word patterns. Results indicate the composite KOS improved on existing models identified in the literature for strong forward-looking sentiment. In one company, a statistically significant association was found between increasing diversity of assertive forward-looking sentiment and subsequent declining relative business performance. This supported the Pollyanna effect: the social phenomena of over-positive business language in that company. Sharp increases in mentions of the 'future' and 'learnings' were discovered in another company which may be explained by an industrial disaster and subsequent crisis management rhetoric, supporting discourse of renewal theory. This study shows that improvements can be made to existing KOS used to detect forward-looking sentiment in reports. Adopting critical realism as a philosophy when analysing 'big data' may lead to improved theory generation and the potential for differentiating insights.",,,

The objective of the project is to improve significantly the efficiency and the quality of cross-language and cross-cultural information exchange and knowledge discovery by facilitating concept mapping and information retrieval between Western and Eastern medical traditions. Major facets of the conceptual framework include Diagnostic Categories, Therapeutic Preparations, Human Anatomy, Selected Diseases/Medical Conditions, and Basics of Traditional Systems.

The authors analyze three weblogs (Biblioatipici, Letture and Andrea Marchitelli’s blog) to demonstrate that different contents may be classified using the appropriate scheme.; Biblioatipici is a weblog about temporary workers in libraries and Italian documentation centres, indexed with a faceted scheme, home made by authors. Letture, a diary about reading and books, is indexed by DDC; finally, Andrea Marchitelli’s blog, a weblog about digital libraries and open access, is indexed by JITA, the scheme used for indexing e-prints in some different open archives.; The three applications are presented starting from the most complex scheme (i.e. the faceted one) to the simple but least functional (JITA), passing through a traditional bibliographic classification scheme, the Dewey Decimal Classification.; The analysis demonstrates that different web contents can efficiently be classified with different schemes. In particular, with the facets one (Biblioatipici) the indexer is able to generate the needed classes in the indexing phase. Moreover with a small number of facets and foci one can obtain an exponential number of classes. Finally, one of the advantages for the user is that the faceted scheme allows multiple accesses on the basis of different information requirements, in addition to being coherent and intuitive. DDC scheme can be more suitable than the first web pages or blogs performing a sort of digital library. In this case in fact the DDC scheme constitutes a consolidated classification standard, widespread in a huge quantity of libraries and the use of a different scheme might get confusion. JITA scheme, finally, can find a huge applicability in web pages (or blogs) in LIS field showing several advantages: it’s very simple and essentialy pragmatic, intuitive and coherent. It’s a conservative scheme because structurally closed, in fact it does not allow the classifier to insert new LCS’s categories. If, from a certain point of view, this is a disadvantage, vice versa this feature is really useful because get a complete matching between classes of all the web pages implemented with it.",,,

The abstract mathematical states of a Turing machine (a kind of calculus universalis that Leibniz was looking for) are claimed to correspond to equivalent psychological states. Artefacts are turned into faithful models of human cognition. A further step toward the Computational Theory of Mind was the physical symbol system hypothesis, contending to have found a necessary and sufficient criterion for the presence of intelligence in operative mediums. This, together with Chomsky's foundational work on linguistics, led naturally to the Computational Theory of Mind as set out by Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn.

There have been several attempts to organize the resources on the World Wide Web. Some of them have tried to use traditional library classification schemes such as the Library of Congress Classification, the Dewey Decimal Classification and others. However there is a need to assign proper subject headings to them and present them in a logical or hierarchical sequence to cater to the need for browsing. This paper attempts to describe an experimental system designed to organize and provide access to web documents using a faceted pre-coordinate indexing system based on the Deep Structure Indexing System (DSIS) derived from POPSI (Postulate based Permuted Subject Indexing) of Bhattacharyya, and the facet analysis and chain indexing system of Ranganathan. A prototype software system has been designed to create a database of records specifying Web documents according to the Dublin Core and to input a faceted subject heading according to DSIS. Synonymous terms are added to the standard terms in the heading using appropriate symbols. Once the data are entered along with a description and the URL of the web document, the record is stored in the system. More than one faceted subject heading can be assigned to a record depending on the content of the original document. The system stores the surrogates and keeps the faceted subject headings separately after establishing a link. The search is carried out on index entries derived from the faceted subject heading using the chain indexing technique. If a single term is input, the system searches for its presence in the faceted subject headings and displays the subject headings in a sorted sequence reflecting an organizing sequence. If the number of retrieved headings is too large (running into more than a page) the user has the option of entering another search term to be searched in combination. The system searches subject headings already retrieved and looks for those containing the second term. The retrieved faceted subject headings can be displayed and browsed. When the relevant subject heading is selected the system displays the records with their URLs. Using the URL, the original document on the web can be accessed.

An aim of this research is characterizing such culturally relevant relationships and organizing them in a vocabulary. Use cases or examples of relationships between objects suggested by curators or mentioned in literature and in the conceptual models as FRBR/LRM, CIDOC CRM and RiC-CM, were collected and used as examples or inspiration of cultural relevant relationships. Relationships identified are collated and compared for identifying those with the same or similar meaning, synthesized and normalized. A set of thirty-three culturally relevant relationships are identified and formalized as a LOD property vocabulary to be used by digital curators to interlink digital collections.

There have been several attempts to organize the resources on the World Wide Web. Some of them have tried to use traditional library classification schemes such as the Library of Congress Classification, the Dewey Decimal Classification and others. However there is a need to assign proper subject headings to them and present them in a logical or hierarchical sequence to cater to the need for browsing. This paper attempts to describe an experimental system designed to organize and provide access to web documents using a faceted pre-coordinate indexing system based on the Deep Structure Indexing System (DSIS) derived from POPSI (Postulate based Permuted Subject Indexing) of Bhattacharyya, and the facet analysis and chain indexing system of Ranganathan. A prototype software system has been designed to create a database of records specifying Web documents according to the Dublin Core and to input a faceted subject heading according to DSIS. Synonymous terms are added to the standard terms in the heading using appropriate symbols. Once the data are entered along with a description and the URL of the web document, the record is stored in the system. More than one faceted subject heading can be assigned to a record depending on the content of the original document. The system stores the surrogates and keeps the faceted subject headings separately after establishing a link. The search is carried out on index entries derived from the faceted subject heading using the chain indexing technique. If a single term is input, the system searches for its presence in the faceted subject headings and displays the subject headings in a sorted sequence reflecting an organizing sequence. If the number of retrieved headings is too large (running into more than a page) the user has the option of entering another search term to be searched in combination. The system searches subject headings already retrieved and looks for those containing the second term. The retrieved faceted subject headings can be displayed and browsed. When the relevant subject heading is selected the system displays the records with their URLs. Using the URL, the original document on the web can be accessed.

The traditional borderline between both variations of indexing, however, should not conceal fundamental commonalities of the two approaches. For example, thesaurus construction and usage, quite common in databases, has hardly been encountered in book indexing so far. Database indexing, on the other hand, has hardly made use of subheadings of the syntax-displaying type, quite common in book indexing. Most database users also prefer precombining vocabulary units and reject concept analysis. However, insisting on precombining descriptors in a large database vocabulary may, in the long run, well be destructive to the quality of indexing and of the searches. A complementary approach is conceivable which provides both precombinations and analyzed subjects, both index language syntax and subheadings, and provides access to an information system via precombinations, without jeopardizing the manageability of the vocabulary. Such an approach causes considerable costs in input because it involves a great deal of intellectual work. On the other hand, much time and costs will be saved in the use of the system.

Symbol manipulation systems had been considered by Leibniz as a methodology of inferring knowledge in a secure and purely mechanical fashion. Such inference calculi were considered as mere artefacts which could not possibly encompass all human knowledge acquisition. In Alan Turing's work one notices a crucial shift of perspective. The abstract mathematical states of a Turing machine (a kind of calculus universalis that Leibniz was looking for) are claimed to correspond to equivalent psychological states. Artefacts are turned into faithful models of human cognition. A further step toward the Computational Theory of Mind was the physical symbol system hypothesis, contending to have found a necessary and sufficient criterion for the presence of intelligence in operative mediums. This, together with Chomsky's foundational work on linguistics, led naturally to the Computational Theory of Mind as set out by Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn. We discuss problematic aspects of this theory. Then we deal with another paradigm of the Computational Theory of Mind based on network automata.

It was found that a large number of the main concepts of sociology are either not represented in the schedule or mentioned in the scope note only along with the main headings. A table shows one hundred main concepts of sociology arranged and classified within ten major categories or sections, and their provision in the DDC.

This paper looks at one particular part of knowledge organization work, namely classification theory, and asks 1) what are the contours of this intellectual space, and, 2) what have we produced in the theoretical reflection on constructing, implementing, and evaluating classification schemes? The preliminary findings from this work are that classification theory can be separated into three kinds: foundational classification theory, first-order classification theory, and second-order classification theory, each with its own concerns and objects of study.",,,

Part IV, finally, offers a speculative explanation of these problems. My central hypothesis is that an aversion to neologisms - especially newly coined words - impedes the introduction and acceptance of new concepts. The pressure for standardization of terminology compounds this difficulty. There are three kinds of neologisms: 1. newly coined words (neoterisms), 2. phases composed of familiar words (phrasal tags) and 3. familiar words for which new meanings have been stipulated (meta-terms). Neologisms in the form of phrases containing familiar words are often found in ISO 1087. Some perplexing ambiguities in ISO 1087 occur when new meanings are stipulated for familiar words, creating terminological metaphors (meta-terms) that are often obscure. Such meta-terms abound in the terminology of Terminology. Increased willingness to accept well-formed new words (neoterisms) would greatly simplify the development of a more adequate terminology for Terminology. The use of pleonasms is recommended as a technique to overcome ambiguity by linking familiar words having new meanings (meta-terms) to new words for the same concepts (neoterisms) and as a simple way to facilitate the introduction of such neoterisms.",,,

Symbol manipulation systems had been considered by Leibniz as a methodology of inferring knowledge in a secure and purely mechanical fashion. Such inference calculi were considered as mere artefacts which could not possibly encompass all human knowledge acquisition. In Alan Turing's work one notices a crucial shift of perspective. The abstract mathematical states of a Turing machine (a kind of calculus universalis that Leibniz was looking for) are claimed to correspond to equivalent psychological states. Artefacts are turned into faithful models of human cognition. A further step toward the Computational Theory of Mind was the physical symbol system hypothesis, contending to have found a necessary and sufficient criterion for the presence of intelligence in operative mediums. This, together with Chomsky's foundational work on linguistics, led naturally to the Computational Theory of Mind as set out by Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn. We discuss problematic aspects of this theory. Then we deal with another paradigm of the Computational Theory of Mind based on network automata. This sub-symbolic paradigm seems to avoid problems occuring in symbolic computations, like the proble frame problem and graceful degradation",081-453-122-790-793,"Possibilities are being explored to use traditional bibliographic tools, like Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), Library of Congress Classification (LCC), Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), and Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), to improve the organization of information resources on the Internet.

A review of selected Web sites that use DDC to organize Web resources indicates, however, that the full potential of the DDC scheme for this purpose has not been realized. While the review found that the DDC classification structure was more effective when compared with other knowledge organization systems, we conclude that DDC needs to be further enhanced to make it more suitable for this application. As widely reported in the professional literature, OCLC has conducted research on the potential of DDC for organizing Web resources.

And yet, a question still seems unanswered: how was its literature classified and retrieved? It is a subject that has been given surprisingly little attention by the field of library-and-information science―indeed, by scholarship in general. Furthermore, a certain way of thinking has influenced the few answers that have so far been attempted. It is as if the scholars of our era have tried to identify the modern, physical library in the Hellenistic library in Alexandria. But such an approach is biased in a basic way: It simply does not consider the impact of the cultural and intellectual context of the library. This article differs fundamentally, because I reject the notion that the library was like those of today. Accordingly, an entirely new way of understanding how the library actually worked, in terms of classification and retrieval processes is presented. The key element is to understand the library both as a physical structure and as a struc- ture in the memory of the Alexandrian scholars. In this article, these structures are put together so as to propose a new interpretation of the library.",,,

The following question is considered: Could Repertory Grid technique be used as a tool in the creation of metadata? It is postulated that repertory grid technique may be used as a tool for creating metadata labels, or tags, where the labels or tags describe entities, which may be images, documents or expressions. Repertory grid technique can provide a method for examining the detail about an individual's mental models, or personal construct systems of lifeworld entities, which may include images, documents or expressions. The question were considered by looking at the results of an earlier study, which explored the personal constructs of systems analysts using the repertory grid technique to examine the mental conceptualizations that determine the extent of difference in conceptualization. Categorical core areas of expressions used during software requirements development emerge through classification of the conceptualizations of expressions elicited via the repertory grid interviews. Repertory grid also reveals, through cluster analysis, the subtle difference in the way each participant conceptually related one expression to another expression. The differences in conceptual relationship of expressions or concepts could represent insight about how people view entities of a lifeworld. In a situation where metadata are used to label entities of a lifeworld for organization and retrieval of information, the differences in conceptual relationships might influence the metadata created and how they are used in the lifeworld for the organization and retrieval of information.",,,

The best efforts to achieve an arrangement char is helpful to users will be thwarted by the multifaceted nature of these items and the specific needs of the user and the library. Items on a particular subject will be scattered throughout the library building(s) across disciplines, by physical form, by frequency of use and whether and for how long they may be borrowed. Even though the rich information content of multifaceted items may be represented in the notation, the items required by a user will be scattered across library shelves when the item is placed in a single relative location. This paper explores these issues using examples from a University Library classified using the Dea ey Decimal Classification Scheme (DDC). The electronic context of the library OPAC can transcend the constraints imposed by the predominantly physical nature of library collections, yet the current use of classification schemes in on-line systems retains many of these limitations. Examples of such systems applying DDC on the World Wide Web are discussed and compared with a system that seeks to use DDC in what is called view-based searching. The interface and the resulting browsing and searching capability of a View-Based Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) are described. Ways in which subject. access to library collections can be improved and disciplinary scatter resolved by assigning multiple class numbers to items and exploiting the rich Dewey structure in a faceted form are discussed. It is suggested that the informative power of visual classificatory structures at the search interface will be beneficial to the broader learning experience of the user. The paper concludes that the application of classification schemes in electronic interfaces should not be bound by the physical constraints that no longer apply in an electronic context but be exploited to provide a complete, flexible and individual interface as determined by the needs of each user.",098-507-725-113-618,"Bibliographic classification systems purport to organize the world of knowledge for information storage and retrieval purposes in libraries and bibliographies, both manual and online. The major systems that have predominated during the twentieth century were originally predicated on the academic disciplines. This structural principle is no longer adequate because multidisciplinary knowledge production has overtaken more traditional disciplinary perspectives and produced communities of cooperation whose documents cannot be accommodated in a disciplinary structure. This paper addresses the problems the major classifications face, reports some attempts to revise these systems to accommodate multidisciplinary works more appropriately, and describes some theoretical research perspectives that attempt to reorient classification research toward the pluralistic needs of multidisciplinary knowledge creation and the perspectives of different discourse communities. Traditionally, the primary desiderata of classification systems were mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity. The need to respond to multidisciplinary research may mean that hospitality will replace mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity as the most needed and useful characteristics of classification systems in both theory and practice.",,,

However, current KO solutions are limited in expressivity as they only support queries by document properties, e.g., by title, author and subject. In parallel, within the Artificial Intelligence and Semantic Web communities, Knowledge Representation (KR), has developed very powerful end expressive techniques which, via the use of ontologies, support queries by any entity property (e.g., the properties of the entities described in a document). However, KR has not scaled yet to the level of KO, mainly because of the lack of a precise and scalable entity specification methodology. In this paper we present DERA, a new methodology, inspired by the faceted approach, as introduced in KO, that retains all the advantages of KR and compensates for the limitations of KO.

Symbol manipulation systems had been considered by Leibniz as a methodology of inferring knowledge in a secure and purely mechanical fashion. Such inference calculi were considered as mere artefacts which could not possibly encompass all human knowledge acquisition. In Alan Turing's work one notices a crucial shift of perspective. The abstract mathematical states of a Turing machine (a kind of calculus universalis that Leibniz was looking for) are claimed to correspond to equivalent psychological states. Artefacts are turned into faithful models of human cognition. A further step toward the Computational Theory of Mind was the physical symbol system hypothesis, contending to have found a necessary and sufficient criterion for the presence of intelligence in operative mediums. This, together with Chomsky's foundational work on linguistics, led naturally to the Computational Theory of Mind as set out by Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn. We discuss problematic aspects of this theory. Then we deal with another paradigm of the Computational Theory of Mind based on network automata. This sub-symbolic paradigm seems to avoid problems occuring in symbolic computations, like the proble frame problem and graceful degradation",100-423-835-468-358,"Creative professionals in advertising, marketing, design and journalism search for images to visually represent a concept for their project. The main purpose of this paper is to present search facets derived from an analysis of documents known as briefs, which are widely used in creative industries as requirement documents describing information needs. The briefs specify the type of image required, such as the content and context of use for the image and represent the topic from which the searcher builds an image query. We take three main sources—user image search behaviour, briefs, and image search engine search facets to examine the search facets for image searching in order to examine the following research question—are search facet schemes for image search engines sufficient for user needs, or is revision needed? We found that there are three main classes of user search facet, which include business, contextual and image related information. The key argument in the paper is that the facet “keyword/tag” is ambiguous and does not support user needs for more generic descriptions to broaden search or specific descriptions to narrow their search — we suggest that a more detailed search facet scheme would be appropriate.",,,

This paper demonstrates how these different methods have been applied to the classification of psychology. An etymological approach is insufficient to define the subject matter of psychology, because other terms can be used to describe the same domain. To define the subject matter of psychology from the point of view of its formal establishment as a science and academic discipline (in Leipzig, 1879) is also insufficient because this was done in specific historical circumstances, which narrowed the subject matter to physiologically-related issues. When defining the subject area of a scientific field it is necessary to consider how different ontological and epistemological views have made their influences. A subject area and the approaches by which this subject area has been studied cannot be separated from each other without tracing their mutual historical interactions. The classification of a subject field is theory-laden and thus cannot be neutral or ahistorical. If classification research can claim to have a method that is more general than the study of the concrete developments in the single knowledge fields the key is to be found in the general epistemological theories. It is shown how basic epistemological assumptions have formed the different approaches to psychology during the 20th century. The progress in the understanding of basic philosophical questions is decisive both for the development of a knowledge field and as the point of departure of classification. The theoretical principles developed in this paper are applied in a brief analysis of some concrete classification systems, including the one used by PsycINFO / Psychological Abstracts.

Subsequently, a qualitative textual analysis of the tags was made in order to find out by analysis which tagging strategies are represented in the data material. This led to four conclusions. 1) the distribution of keywords follows classic power law; 2) distinct tagging communities are identifiable; 3) the most frequently used tags are situated on a general-specific axis; and 4) nine distinct tagging strategies are observed.

From the very beginning, UDC was designed to represent the universe of knowledge as an integral whole allowing for subjects/concepts from all fields of knowledge to be combined, linked and the nature of their relationships made explicit. In Otlet's original design, the emphasis for his new type of classification was on the coordination of classmarks at the point of searching, i.e., post-coordination, which he firmly rooted in an expressive notational system. While some UDC classes exhibit various patterns of facet analytical theory proper, others, although used in an analytico-synthetic fashion, follow less canonical structural patterns. The authors highlight the lack of connection made throughout the various stages of UDC restructuring between: a) theoretical requirements of an overarching facet analytical theory as a founding principle guiding the construction of schedules; and, b) practical requirements for an analytico-synthetic classification in terms of notational presentation and data structure that enables its use in indexing and retrieval, as well as its management online.",,,

The map is composed of seven parts: foundation (meta-knowledge), social worker, environment, organization, area of practice, method, and client. The study followed a qualitative four-phase research methodology. The first phase was a phenomenological analysis of the basic characteristics of social work as a social service. The analysis resulted in a seven-facet subject classification. In the second phase the conceptual skeleton was elaborated, and adjusted to the field of social work by a grounded-theory methodology. The data used for grounding the model were 14 social work resources. The model was tested in the third phase by classifying 200 terms randomly selected from the Dictionary of Social Work (Barker, 1999). Finally, in the fourth phase we classified 197 papers published in two leading journals, Social Work and Social Service Review, in three successive years, 1997, 1998, and 1999.

It is used to support regular expression matching and thus annotate OT concepts by using the GATE developer tool. This speeds up the time-consuming development of the ontology, which is important for experts in the domain who face time constraints and high workloads. The rules provide significant results: the pattern matching of OT concepts based on the lookup list produced 403 correct concepts and the accuracy was generally higher. Using NLP technique is a good approach to reducing the domain expert’s work, and the results can be evaluated. This study contributes to the understanding of ontology development and evaluation methods to address the knowledge gap of using ontology in the decision support system component of occupational therapy.",,,

We briefly introduce the beginning and principles of folksonomy and discuss the categorizing concept of folksonomies on the basis of the computer program delicious. The selection of the metadata tagged is not accidental, rather tagging follows a pattern that proves to be the pattern for the classic power law, which, in many complex systems is seen to unfold as an imitation-dynamic that creates an asymmetry, where a few descriptive metadata are often reproduced and the majority seldom reproduced. In del.icio.us, it is the very broadband basic subject headings that are often reproduced and achieve power in the system - which in cognitive psychology is called cognitive basic categories - while the small, more specific subject headings are seldom reproduced. The law of power's underlying imitation-dynamic in del.icio.us is explained from the perspective of different theoretical paradigms, i.e. network, economy and cognition. The theorectical and speculative conclusion is that the law of power and asymmetry is biased by a cognitive economizing through a simplification principle in the users' construction of descriptive metadata. Free tagging in folksonomies is comparable to empirical experiments in free categorization. Users often choose broad basic categories, because that requires the least cognitive effort. The consequences are that folksonomy is not necessarily a better, more realistic and cheaper method of creating metadata than that which can be generated through taxonomies, faceted classification or search algorithms. Folksonomy as a self-organizing system likely cannot create better and cheaper descriptive metadata.",,,

Symbol manipulation systems had been considered by Leibniz as a methodology of inferring knowledge in a secure and purely mechanical fashion. Such inference calculi were considered as mere artefacts which could not possibly encompass all human knowledge acquisition. In Alan Turing's work one notices a crucial shift of perspective. The abstract mathematical states of a Turing machine (a kind of calculus universalis that Leibniz was looking for) are claimed to correspond to equivalent psychological states. Artefacts are turned into faithful models of human cognition. A further step toward the Computational Theory of Mind was the physical symbol system hypothesis, contending to have found a necessary and sufficient criterion for the presence of intelligence in operative mediums. This, together with Chomsky's foundational work on linguistics, led naturally to the Computational Theory of Mind as set out by Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn. We discuss problematic aspects of this theory. Then we deal with another paradigm of the Computational Theory of Mind based on network automata.

The study establishes eight classificatory models for resources available to Internet users. Internet resources can be classified by subjects, objects, applications, users, locations, reference sources, media, and languages. The first five models are content-related; namely they characterize the content of the resource.

The study identifies and formulates the eight classificatory models, analyzes their rationales, and discusses alternative ways to combine them in a faceted integrated classification scheme.",,,

This paper attempts to describe an experimental system designed to organize and provide access to web documents using a faceted pre-coordinate indexing system based on the Deep Structure Indexing System (DSIS) derived from POPSI (Postulate based Permuted Subject Indexing) of Bhattacharyya, and the facet analysis and chain indexing system of Ranganathan. A prototype software system has been designed to create a database of records specifying Web documents according to the Dublin Core and to input a faceted subject heading according to DSIS. Synonymous terms are added to the standard terms in the heading using appropriate symbols. Once the data are entered along with a description and the URL of the web document, the record is stored in the system. More than one faceted subject heading can be assigned to a record depending on the content of the original document. The system stores the surrogates and keeps the faceted subject headings separately after establishing a link. The search is carried out on index entries derived from the faceted subject heading using the chain indexing technique. If a single term is input, the system searches for its presence in the faceted subject headings and displays the subject headings in a sorted sequence reflecting an organizing sequence. If the number of retrieved headings is too large (running into more than a page) the user has the option of entering another search term to be searched in combination. The system searches subject headings already retrieved and looks for those containing the second term. The retrieved faceted subject headings can be displayed and browsed. When the relevant subject heading is selected the system displays the records with their URLs. Using the URL, the original document on the web can be accessed. The prototype system developed in a Windows NT environment using ASP and a web server is under rigorous testing. The database and index management routines need further development.",188-192-965-023-127,"Work centered design of classification schemes is an emerging area of research which poses particular challenges to domain analysis and scheme construction. A key challenge in work centered design of classification schemes is the evolving semantics of work. This article introduces a work centered approach to the design of classification schemes, based on the framework of cognitive work analysis. We launch collaborative task situations as a new unit of analysis for capturing evolving semantic structures in work domains. An example case from a cognitive work analysis of three national film research archives illustrates the application of the framework for identifying actors' needs for a classification scheme to support collaborative knowledge integration. It is concluded that a main contribution of the new approach is support for empirical analysis and overall design of classification schemes that can serve as material interfaces for actors' negotiations and integration of knowledge perspectives during collaborative work.",,,

69,69hello,094-882-702-642-495,69,"We sketch the historic transformation of culturally grown techniques of symbol manipulation, such as basic arithmetic in the decimal number system, to the full-fledged version of the Computational Theory of Mind. Symbol manipulation systems had been considered by Leibniz as a methodology of inferring knowledge in a secure and purely mechanical fashion. Such inference calculi were considered as mere artefacts which could not possibly encompass all human knowledge acquisition. In Alan Turing's work one notices a crucial shift of perspective. The abstract mathematical states of a Turing machine (a kind of calculus universalis that Leibniz was looking for) are claimed to correspond to equivalent psychological states. Artefacts are turned into faithful models of human cognition. A further step toward the Computational Theory of Mind was the physical symbol system hypothesis, contending to have found a necessary and sufficient criterion for the presence of intelligence in operative mediums. This, together with Chomsky's foundational work on linguistics, led naturally to the Computational Theory of Mind as set out by Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn. We discuss problematic aspects of this theory. Then we deal with another paradigm of the Computational Theory of Mind based on network automata. This sub-symbolic paradigm seems to avoid problems occuring in symbolic computations, like the proble frame problem and graceful degradation",144-109-666-243-086,"<p>Recent years have seen the rise of user-generated contents (UGCs) in online social media. Diverse UGC sources and information overload are making it increasingly difficult to satisfy personalized information needs. To organize UGCs in a user-centered way, we should not only map them based on textual topics but also link them with users and even user communities. We propose a multi-dimensional framework to organize information by connecting UGCs, users, and user communities. First, we use a topic model to generate a topic hierarchy from UGCs. Second, an author-topic model is applied to learn user interests. Third, user communities are detected through a label propagation algorithm. Finally, a multi-dimensional information organization pattern is formulated based on similarities among the topic hierarchies of UGCs, user interests, and user communities. The results reveal that: 1) our proposed framework can organize information from multiple sources in a user-centered way; 2) hierarchical topic structures can provide comprehensive and in-depth topics for users; and, 3) user communities are efficient in helping people to connect with others who have similar interests.</p>",,,

The best efforts to achieve an arrangement char is helpful to users will be thwarted by the multifaceted nature of these items and the specific needs of the user and the library. Items on a particular subject will be scattered throughout the library building(s) across disciplines, by physical form, by frequency of use and whether and for how long they may be borrowed. Even though the rich information content of multifaceted items may be represented in the notation, the items required by a user will be scattered across library shelves when the item is placed in a single relative location. This paper explores these issues using examples from a University Library classified using the Dea ey Decimal Classification Scheme (DDC). The electronic context of the library OPAC can transcend the constraints imposed by the predominantly physical nature of library collections, yet the current use of classification schemes in on-line systems retains many of these limitations. Examples of such systems applying DDC on the World Wide Web are discussed and compared with a system that seeks to use DDC in what is called view-based searching. The interface and the resulting browsing and searching capability of a View-Based Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) are described. Ways in which subject. access to library collections can be improved and disciplinary scatter resolved by assigning multiple class numbers to items and exploiting the rich Dewey structure in a faceted form are discussed. It is suggested that the informative power of visual classificatory structures at the search interface will be beneficial to the broader learning experience of the user. The paper concludes that the application of classification schemes in electronic interfaces should not be bound by the physical constraints that no longer apply in an electronic context but be exploited to provide a complete, flexible and individual interface as determined by the needs of each user.",092-507-541-687-774,"Ontologies have an important role in knowledge organization and information retrieval. Domain ontologies are composed of concepts represented by domain relevant terms. Existing approaches of ontology construction make use of statistical and linguistic information to extract domain relevant terms. The quality and the quantity of this information influence the accuracy of terminologyextraction approaches and other steps in knowledge extraction and information retrieval. This paper proposes an approach forhandling domain relevant terms from Arabic non-diacriticised semi-structured corpora. In input, the structure of documentsis exploited to organize knowledge in a contextual graph, which is exploitedto extract relevant terms. This network contains simple and compound nouns handled by a morphosyntactic shallow parser. The noun phrases are evaluated in terms of termhood and unithood by ; means of possibilistic measures. We apply a qualitative approach, which weighs terms according to their positions in the structure of the document. In output, the extracted knowledge is organized as network modeling dependencies between terms, which can be exploited to infer semantic relations.We test our approach on three specific domain corpora. The goal of this evaluation is to check if our model for organizing and exploiting contextual knowledge will improve the accuracy of extraction of simple and compound nouns. We also investigate the role of compound nouns in improving information retrieval results.",,,
