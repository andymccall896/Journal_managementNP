      "the real challenge of today lies in exploring how computers will enable us to do what was not possible previously. the paper attempts to provoke thought about new frontiers of visual knowledge organization. computers introduce the possibility of interchangeable media. they offer multiple nodes of access to a given term or object. they enable us to approach knowledge on different levels. a scheme of 10 levels is proposed and some consequences for visual knowledge at each of these levels is considered briefly. the final section of the paper considers four navigational tools: questions, maps, meters, and tracking\n",
      "some 25 years ago the leiden art historian van de waal, inventor of iconclass, developed an icon knowledge system called beeldleer. after a brief review of this system the author does borrow some central ideas of beeldleer to discuss a method of studying historically the elementary means of artistic expression with the use of hypertext concepts. the potential of a social construction of information in this field is being emphasized. finally the design of a pilot study in an educational context will be discussed\n",

      "in 1989, the existence of an online union catalogue, the national bibliographic database-porbase, raised the urgent need for mechanisms of co-operation in the field of subject authority control. a national co-operative project called clip (compatibilizacao de linguagens de indexacao em portugues) was launched. with clip special libraries will assume responsibility for the final content of the authority file with respect to terminology for subject access in different subject areas. reference is made to the general situation in portuguese libraries with respect to the availability and application of subject indexing tools, and also to the work being carried out towards standardization and harmonization of procedures in such matters\n",
      "efforts to build «virtual museums» have focussed predominantly on solving problems of rapidity changing interface technology. insufficient effort has been spent on planning for the «virtual databases» on which these multimedia environments depend, particularly from the viewpoint of scholarly research. the getty art history information program has developed vocabularies that encourage consistency among scholarly documentation projects―regardless of their technical implementations―through terminology standards. two vocabularies intended for control of terminology at the point of data capture are described, and scenarios are proposed for their further utility in navigating the complex databases that underlie the virtual museum\n",
      "attempt to order the main parameters of scientific theory into a coherent taxonomy. to that end, a system unification model (sum) is constructed which serves as a formal frame classifying the salient structures and functions of empirical existence. the terse presentation should give a synopsis of the scope and method of knowledge organization applicable in a global scale.; ; the methodology used is based on a triadic interface paradigm which combines dialectic and syllogic algorithms to arrive at synthetic conclusions of general applications. this holistic perspective situates the static and dynamic contents of matter, energy and information systems in their space-time context. finally, these dimensions are manipulated by formal operational codes to produce systemic and systematic knowledge.; ; the model has been used to demonstrate a new theory of sociophysics which integrates the basic principles of social and natural sciences into an all-inclusive conceptual framework. sociophysics assumes the fundamental isomorphism of nature and culture, thereby projecting heuristic metaphors between them. as a result, it contributes in enhancing, understanding and appreciating the global picture of human reality.\n",

      "changing technological paradigms require a new approach to the definition of standards in the area of art information. technological boundaries between systems are lessening, making new realms of integrated information a possibility. previously separate databases, image bases, computer aided design systems, and geographical information systems are now being linked into multi-media, interdisciplinary information systems. the potential exists to unite other physically separate information resources into a «virtual database», through a common interface which exploits emerging communications networks. such integration will only be possible if all systems are built on a shared intellectual framework; unless the information which is gathered today shares a common conceptual structure, integration in the future will not be possible\n",
      "the paper addresses the ways in which computerization and a thesaurus like the art and architecture thesaurus (aat) influence the organization, description, and understanding of the visual arts. it discusses these issues from the point of view of the aat and considers how its structure and content serve as a bridging mechanism between the many different manifestations of the visual arts and the different types of organizations serving the viewers of art, whether as students, scholars, collections managers, or the enjoying public. this paper shows how a knowledge base like the aat helps this variety of users develop approaches to the visual arts and suggests that the special nature of dealing with image rather than text influences how the thesaurus is structured and applied\n",
      "intended is first of all a preliminary review of the implications that the new approaches to the theory of classification, mainly from cognitive psychology and epistemology may have for information work and research. as a secondary topic the scientific relations existing among information science, epistemology, and the cognitive sciences are discussed. classification is seen as a central activity in all daily and scientific activities, and, of course, of knowledge organization in information services. there is a mutual implication between classification and conceptualization, as the former moves in a natural way to the latter and the best result elaborated for classification is the concept. research in concept theory is a need for a theory of classification. in this direction it is of outstanding importance to integrate the achievements of natural concept formation theory (ncft) as an alternative approach to conceptualization different from the traditional one of logicians and problem solving researchers. in clonclusion both approaches are seen as being complementary: the ncfp approach being closer to the user and the logical one being more suitable for experts, including expert systems\n",
      "knowledge organization in real world situations is a complex task relying on a vast body of knowledge from theories, disciplines, professions, and cultures. this diversity requires a particular instructional design for developing competence in this field. the main features of this design are: real world approach, critical incident analysis, the work on interdependent tasks as a problem-solving method, implementation of solutions, permanent evaluation. it is proposed that documentation of critical incidents, solutions and implementation results serve as a base for establishing knowledge organization as a new interdisciplinary field\n",
      "this article presents a new taxonomy or designators (a.k.a. designations), covering terms, symbols and ordinals. although ordinals are widely used, they have not been conceptualized in terminology literature as designators per se. each category is broken down according to the basic form of the designator. term types are monomials, polynomials, and initialisms. symbol types are alphabetic and graphic. and ordinal types are alphabetic and numeric. combinations (hybrids) of these types are also discussed. the proposed terms and concepts are contrasted with those in iso 1087 (terminology-vocabulary, 1990) and approximately 48 terms are defined\n",
      "the perspectives of reorganization of the library-bibliographical classification (lbc) are described. the possibilities of a transformation of this classification system into a scientifically based «knowledge base» for traditional and electronic catalogues are shown. difficulties and obstacles in pursuing the completion of lbc reconstruction are expounded\n",
      "it has rarely been seen as a task for art history to give systematic, consistent and detailed access to the subject matter of large numbers of historical images. this lack of systematic documentation severely handicaps all historical research that involves the interpretation of iconographic detail. it leaves us unable to count the frequency with which subjects have been represented, or with which iconographic particularities occur. this article asks whether the use of the iconographic classification system iconclass will help to create countable iconographic information. its first part deals with the considerations that have guided the shape of the computer edition that has recently been made available. these may be relevant for the electronic publication of classification systems in general. in the second part a few statement about gestures are analyzed against the background of an existing corpus of systematically described images . this analysis draws attention to the paradox that iconographic detail often plays a key role in art historical discourse, but must do so on the basis of incidental information\n",
      "a unifying theory has been developed that draws together a compatible set of methods for classification, and shows why others should be rejected. the methods reveal polythetic groups and sequences, and evaluate the quality and the best identifying characters for each group. the theory defines the rules for the fuzzy uses of 40 interacting options for group studies in a new 12 000 line fortran program called uniter, available from the author. the theory and the program's options help to show the nature of the achievements and failures of humanity's powerful grouping sense. this approach offers useful understandings in an extremely wide range of fields, examples of which are given. both research and teaching should take account of this development\n",
      "third part of a series of articles of which pt.1 was published in ko 23(1996)no.1, p.25-33, pt.2 in no.3, p.157-168. pt.4 will follow in ko 24(1997)no.1. in addition to the important distinctions between the fundamental concepts and terms (tags) used in onomantics and terminology, as reported in the first two parts of this essay, several other interesting comparisons can be made. first, with reference to formats, both the structure and nomenclature used for terminological entries (records) in iso 1087 parallel those found in dictionaries and suggest a semantic rather than an onomantic point of view. second, a large number of borrowed terms taken from lexicography and linguistics can be found in this glossary for the terminology of terminology. sometimes the definitions for these terms identify them as borrowed concepts drawn from the vocabulary used by lexicographers. however, sometimes new meanings are stipulated for these terms without any markings to show that they are not borrowed concepts. moreover, in all these cases, since the original and the newly stipulated concepts are similar, ambiguity is unavoidable. third, some concepts that might be useful for terminologists are not included in iso 1087: a few examples are explained. they are all concepts which lexicographers do not need and, consequently, they have no terms for them. it seems apparent that they have been omitted from the vocabulary of terminology simply because they are new concepts without established terms. to explain the reasons for the formats, terms and omissions found in the leading glossary for the terminology of terminology takes us into a realm of speculation that is too complicated for inclusion here, but i will discuss it in part iv of this series, with a focus on the problems of neologisms\n",
      "this paper is put up for discussion to help knowledge organization find its proper place. to begin with, a few basic concepts from the field of communication theory are defined. the new concepts permit the conclusion that what we are facing at present is not a flood of information but one of messages, and that this latter flood must not be equated indiscriminately with a knowledge flood. messages must be judged on their contents. to this end, «knowledge» is subdivided into «core-», «peripheral», and «pseudo-knowledge», and it is argued that the great majority of scientific publications contains peripheral and pseudoknowledge. with the aid of two interlocking and self-amplying recursive mechanisms it is shown that and how pseudoknowledge is more and more gaining disciplines, hence precisely in those fields which deal with social problems in the broadest sense of the world; thus a deficit of knowledge on which to base action is produced, leading to a general disorientation - a modern form of ignorance, keenly manifesting it self at present in a crisis of leadership. the research tasks resulting from the above for knowledge organization are roughly outlined\n",
      "attention is drawn to the inadequacies ofthe existing classification schemes as pointed out by individuals and groups concerned with classification research. the article is based on an earlier study by the author, which identified and arranged in a filiatory way the main concepts of sociology and determined their relative significance as headings in a classification scheme the sociology schedule in the dewey decimal classification was examined on the basis of nine evaluation criteria, as e.g. arrangement of major categories, provision for main concepts, use of phrased headings instead of individual key terms, and scattering of related concepts in the schedule. it was found that a large number of the main concepts of sociology are either not represented in the schedule or mentioned in the scope note only along with the main headings. a table shows one hundred main concepts of sociology arranged and classified within ten major categories or sections, and their provision in the ddc. the study suggests that the ddc needs serious reconsideration with regard to the main headings/categories provided as class headings, terminology used for the concepts, the filiatory structure adopted, and the representation of the main concepts of sociology.\n",
      "as a result of the transition to full-text storage, multimedia and networking, information systems are becoming more efficient but at the same time more difficult to use, in particular because users are confronted with information volumes that increasingly exceed individual processing capacities. consequently, there is an increase in the demand for user aids such as summarising techniques. against this background, the interdisciplinary dagstuhl seminar summarising text for intelligent communication, (dec. 1993) outlined the academic state of the art with regard to summarising (abstracting) and proposed future directions for research and system development\n",
      "in the literature of knowledge organization, metaphors and images such as 'tree ofknowledge', 'map ofknowledge' or the 'world as a network' play an important role. this imagery - although not yet thoroughly documented - should be examined from the various points of view of epistemology, the typology ofmetaphors, discourse analysis, metaphorology and iconography. the crucial point : not only knowledge as such, but also its organization, is an essential part of our cultural heritage. (author)\n",
      "this paper introduces a scheme for classifications of concepts. it is founded on the triplet model of concepts. 'this model depicts a concept by means of three kinds of knowledge: a concept base, a concept-representing part and the linkage between them. informally, the concept base deals with entities subsumed under a concept and their properties and relations. the concept-representing part deals with tools and forms of representing these entities and their properties and relations in some intelligent system. the linkage deals with establishing the proper correspondences between components of the base and the representing part. each of these knowledge kinds is associated with specific structures related to concepts (symbols, names, statements, images, texts, entities and their properties and relations, procedures of determination of property values, etc.). various informal and formal (mainly set-theoretical) specifications of these structures serve as criteria for triplet classifications of concepts\n",
      "recently, a new book on knowledge organization has been published by greenwood press. the title is information seeking and subject representation: an activity-theoretical approach to information science. this book presents a new general theory for information science and knowledge organization, based on a theory of infomation seeking. the author is dr. birger hjorland, royal school of library and information science. in 1994, he presented his work on theory for ko at the 3 rd international isko conference in copenhagen (hjorland, 1994). the book aims to provide both a new understanding for the foundations of information science and knowledge organization, and to provide new directions in research and teaching within these fields. ko (hanne albrechtsen) has interviewed birger hjorland in copenhagen about his views on knowledge organization and subject representation\n",

      "general linguistic and specific semantic problems arising in multilingual thesaurus construction are well defined in the various textbooks and in the guidelines covering this area. many details are provided on the conceptual equivalence issue, and various ways of dealing with conceptual divergence are described. but when discussing semantic solutions, display options, management issues, or use of technology, specialists and guidelines seldom, if ever, go as far as commenting on whether or not a particular option is truly respectful of a language and its speakers. this paper, based on the premise that in a multilingual thesaurus all languages are equal, reviews the options and solutions offered by the guidelines to the developer of specialized thesauri. it also introduces other problems of a sociocultural, and even of a truly political nature, a prominent feature in the daily life of the thesaurus designer with which the theory and the guidelines do not deal very well\n",
      "starting out from descartes' and leibniz' idea of a mathesis universalis the achievements of modem mathematics are divided into three major parts: the creation of algorithms, the invention of proofs, and the application of mathematics to the description of nature. this applicability has repeatedly been viewed as being just a miracle. one major idea to diminsh the miraculous impression was to view mathematics as exploring the vast area ofall kinds ofabstract structures, thus establishing a huge store of humanly possible thinking from which the physicist has only to choose the structure appropriate for the case before him. there remains, however, the problem of mathematical overdetermination ofphysics: the structures suitable for application usually contain mathematical elements that remain without physical interpretation. the true miracle then seems to be that it is often very difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate those uninterpreted elements from physical theory.\n",

      "traditionally, database indexing and book indexing have been looked upon as being quite distinct and have been kept apart in textbooks and teaching. the traditional borderline between both variations of indexing, however, should not conceal fundamental commonalities of the two approaches. for example, thesaurus construction and usage, quite common in databases, has hardly been encountered in book indexing so far. database indexing, on the other hand, has hardly made use of subheadings of the syntax-displaying type, quite common in book indexing. most database users also prefer precombining vocabulary units and reject concept analysis. however, insisting on precombining descriptors in a large database vocabulary may, in the long run, well be destructive to the quality of indexing and of the searches. a complementary approach is conceivable which provides both precombinations and analyzed subjects, both index language syntax and subheadings, and provides access to an information system via precombinations, without jeopardizing the manageability of the vocabulary. such an approach causes considerable costs in input because it involves a great deal of intellectual work. on the other hand, much time and costs will be saved in the use of the system. in addition, such an approach would endow an information system with survival power.\n",

      "bibliographic classification systems purport to organize the world of knowledge for information storage and retrieval purposes in libraries and bibliographies, both manual and online. the major systems that have predominated during the twentieth century were originally predicated on the academic disciplines. this structural principle is no longer adequate because multidisciplinary knowledge production has overtaken more traditional disciplinary perspectives and produced communities of cooperation whose documents cannot be accommodated in a disciplinary structure. this paper addresses the problems the major classifications face, reports some attempts to revise these systems to accommodate multidisciplinary works more appropriately, and describes some theoretical research perspectives that attempt to reorient classification research toward the pluralistic needs of multidisciplinary knowledge creation and the perspectives of different discourse communities. traditionally, the primary desiderata of classification systems were mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity. the need to respond to multidisciplinary research may mean that hospitality will replace mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity as the most needed and useful characteristics of classification systems in both theory and practice.\n",

      "parts i to iii of this series have examined the terminology of terminology by contrast with the vocabulary of onomantics and identified some of the differences and difficulties revealed by a close study of iso-1087, the most important glossary for terminologists. part iv, finally, offers a speculative explanation of these problems. my central hypothesis is that an aversion to neologisms - especially newly coined words - impedes the introduction and acceptance of new concepts. the pressure for standardization of terminology compounds this difficulty. there are three kinds of neologisms: 1. newly coined words (neoterisms), 2. phases composed of familiar words (phrasal tags) and 3. familiar words for which new meanings have been stipulated (meta-terms). neologisms in the form of phrases containing familiar words are often found in iso 1087. some perplexing ambiguities in iso 1087 occur when new meanings are stipulated for familiar words, creating terminological metaphors (meta-terms) that are often obscure. such meta-terms abound in the terminology of terminology. increased willingness to accept well-formed new words (neoterisms) would greatly simplify the development of a more adequate terminology for terminology. the use of pleonasms is recommended as a technique to overcome ambiguity by linking familiar words having new meanings (meta-terms) to new words for the same concepts (neoterisms) and as a simple way to facilitate the introduction of such neoterisms.\n",

      "different approaches to the classification of a knowledge field include empiristic, rationalistic, historicist, and pragmatic methods. this paper demonstrates how these different methods have been applied to the classification of psychology. an etymological approach is insufficient to define the subject matter of psychology, because other terms can be used to describe the same domain. to define the subject matter of psychology from the point of view of its formal establishment as a science and academic discipline (in leipzig, 1879) is also insufficient because this was done in specific historical circumstances, which narrowed the subject matter to physiologically-related issues. when defining the subject area of a scientific field it is necessary to consider how different ontological and epistemological views have made their influences. a subject area and the approaches by which this subject area has been studied cannot be separated from each other without tracing their mutual historical interactions. the classification of a subject field is theory-laden and thus cannot be neutral or ahistorical. if classification research can claim to have a method that is more general than the study of the concrete developments in the single knowledge fields the key is to be found in the general epistemological theories. it is shown how basic epistemological assumptions have formed the different approaches to psychology during the 20th century. the progress in the understanding of basic philosophical questions is decisive both for the development of a knowledge field and as the point of departure of classification. the theoretical principles developed in this paper are applied in a brief analysis of some concrete classification systems, including the one used by psycinfo / psychological abstracts. the role of classification in modern information retrieval is also briefly discussed.\n",

      "organizing and providing access to the resources on the internet has been a problem area in spite of the availability of sophisticated search engines and other software tools. there have been several attempts to organize the resources on the world wide web. some of them have tried to use traditional library classification schemes such as the library of congress classification, the dewey decimal classification and others. however there is a need to assign proper subject headings to them and present them in a logical or hierarchical sequence to cater to the need for browsing. this paper attempts to describe an experimental system designed to organize and provide access to web documents using a faceted pre-coordinate indexing system based on the deep structure indexing system (dsis) derived from popsi (postulate based permuted subject indexing) of bhattacharyya, and the facet analysis and chain indexing system of ranganathan. a prototype software system has been designed to create a database of records specifying web documents according to the dublin core and to input a faceted subject heading according to dsis. synonymous terms are added to the standard terms in the heading using appropriate symbols. once the data are entered along with a description and the url of the web document, the record is stored in the system. more than one faceted subject heading can be assigned to a record depending on the content of the original document. the system stores the surrogates and keeps the faceted subject headings separately after establishing a link. the search is carried out on index entries derived from the faceted subject heading using the chain indexing technique. if a single term is input, the system searches for its presence in the faceted subject headings and displays the subject headings in a sorted sequence reflecting an organizing sequence. if the number of retrieved headings is too large (running into more than a page) the user has the option of entering another search term to be searched in combination. the system searches subject headings already retrieved and looks for those containing the second term. the retrieved faceted subject headings can be displayed and browsed. when the relevant subject heading is selected the system displays the records with their urls. using the url, the original document on the web can be accessed. the prototype system developed in a windows nt environment using asp and a web server is under rigorous testing. the database and index management routines need further development.\n",

      "this article sets out to investigate genre as a basic criterion in subject indexing of music in libraries and bibliographical databases. the concept of genre is examined in relation to epistemology and to different values and views in both musicology and libraries. the point of departure is to regard music as a domain of actors, institutions and processes. a comprehensive definition of this domain is suggested, which includes several subdomains and discourses. the classical music subdomain and the popular music subdomain are introduced and related to libraries. the article further investigates the concept of paradigm in relation to musicology. it demonstrates how two different paradigms influence the way music is defined, described, classified and indexed and how they are part of a historical context. the fourth part of the article focuses on the concept of genre and the analysis of music and the relation between analytical methods and values/paradigms. in addition, this part focuses on the actors that are responsible for the verbalization of genres in music. the fifth part examines indexing of musical genres with a view to their function as subject access points in databases. the unsatisfactory state of today's practice, as well as the need of a better theoretical foundation of the concept of genre, is documented. the unsatisfactory differentiation in the organising of popular music is exemplified by danish and norwegian libraries, including the dk5 system and the indeksering afmusik guidelines. finally, arguments are put forward for developing an anthropological paradigm in relation to organizing music in libraries.\n",

      "this paper takes a second look at three prevailing main themes in knowledge organization: i) the academic disciplines as the main structural principle; ii) the fiction/non-fiction distinction; and iii) the appropriate unit of analysis in online retrieval systems. the history and origin of bibliographic classification [dewey, bliss, mills, beghtol] are discussed from the perspective of pragmatist philosophy and social studies of science [kuhn, merton, reica]. choices of structural principles in different schemes are found to rely on more or less implicit philosophical foundations, ranging from rationalism to pragmatism. it is further shown how the increasing application of faceted structures as basic structural principles in universal classification schemes [ddc, udc] impose rationalistic principles and structures for knowledge organization which are not in alignment with the development of knowledge in the covered disciplines. further evidence of rationalism in knowledge organization is the fiction/non-fiction distinction, excluding the important role of artistic resources for, in particular, humanistic research. finally, for the analysis of appropriate bibliographic unit, it is argued that there is a need to shift towards a semiotic approach, founded on an understanding of intertextuality, rather than applying standard principles of hierarchical decomposition of documents. it is concluded that a change in classification research is needed, founded on a more historical and social understanding of knowledge.\n",
      "the internet challenges designers of reference resources to structure user interfaces so that they facilitate quick access to bibliographies. designers can organize bibliographies in chronological order of publication, alphabetical listing by author or title and/or subject-headings; or can follow a subject classification scheme from the relevant field. chronological order of publication and alphabetical listings of authors and titles are the simplest ways to organize bibliographic materials, but these methods usually fail to present the thematic relations among the various items. the subject classification is the most systematic presentation, but the most complicated to develop. this study explores the subject classification model, elaborates its rationale, demonstrates an exemplary faceted subject classification scheme grounded in solid scientific foundations, and clarifies the scientific foundations of the three-phase structuring methodology that was utilized. the exemplary classificatory model is a seven-facet subject classification scheme designed for classifying scholarly papers in the field of logotherapy. the study, in particular the scientific structuring methodology, provides an example for structuring bibliographic resources in the social sciences, as well as in other academic fields.\n",

      "this paper describes a proposal for a new approach to thesaurus design and construction that could have significant implications for change in the way multilingual thesauri are handled and integrated with each other. the formula presented here has its origin in the work of the german thesaurus committee and has had input from a number of scientists and practitioners in the field. the emphasis is on the various types of relationships found among concepts, notions and universals in languages. these relationships are analysed and refined beyond the approach taken in existing thesauri. this proposal is very much at the discussion stage and the author invites the assistance of interested readers through criticisms, discussion and dialogue. applications of the proposed thesaurus are included and the major goal of this proposal is to provide the basis for improved design and integration of multilingual thesauri.\n",
      "our hypothesis is that when a user employs an irs, he has an objective to achieve. this objective concerns his information need. in order to achieve this objective, the user generally does some activities using the irs. the irs propose to the user with solutions in response to the queries formulated by the user. the main task of an irs is to provide the user with solutions that are relevant to his information need. this is termed personalization of information. the main axe of our study is the how to personnalize the system's response according to the user's objective. we propose the use of a user model for personnailizing the system's response. in our approach, the user model defines what to represent for each user. the activities of the user during the use of an irs is recorded based on the user model. the analysis and synthesis of these activities are used to provide the user with more relevant solutions according to his objective. three different applications have been developed to validate our approach of personalizing the system?s response and based on an architecture that we defined for a cooperative information retrieval. the three applications are metiore_streems, metiore_loria and metiore_revues. metiore_streems is an irs for managing multimedia information on trees authorized for reforestation by the european union (eu). the project was sponsored under the eu project leonardo. the second application, metiore_loria is used for managing the publications of the computer science laboratory research center, loria, nancy france. the third application metiore_revues is used for the access and analysis of a collection of a journal called relations publiques informations.\n",
      "in this paper, made up of parts i and ii, we investigate the complex relationships between knowledge, information and activity in order to study how a system of activity assistance can help the actor to solve his information problems. through the example of the completion of a pharmacy thesis, we have tried, in part i, to describe, schematize and model the successive phases that make up the whole of this activity. our method of observation and analysis combined the observation of two students preparing their pharmacy theses, the reading of five theses and the reading of six books. we thus propose in a table form, a modelling outline that presents the sequential succession of the ten operational phases describing the completion of a pharmacy thesis following a chronological order: (1) subject definition, (2) documentary research, (3) documents analysis, (4) conceiving of the experimental strategy, (5) experimentation, (6) results interpretation, (7) writing of the thesis, (8) administrative procedures, (9) preparation of the viva, (10) viva. the table also presents the succession of the structural, operational, material and human elements: referents of the activity, subject of the activity, location of the activity, identification of the operations, handled objects, and actors. we have refined the activity analysis by drawing up a structured list, showing the organization of the terms related to the different operational phases. this work is presented in part ii.\n",
      "designing systematic access to internet resources is a major item on the agenda of researchers and practitioners in the field of information science, and is the focus of this study. a critical analysis of classification schemes used in major portals and web classified directories exposes inconsistencies in the way they classify internet resources. the inconsistencies indicate that the developers fail to differentiate the various classificatory models, and are unaware of their different rationales. the study establishes eight classificatory models for resources available to internet users. internet resources can be classified by subjects, objects, applications, users, locations, reference sources, media, and languages. the first five models are content-related; namely they characterize the content of the resource. the other three models are format-related; namely they characterize the format of the resource or its technological infrastructure. the study identifies and formulates the eight classificatory models, analyzes their rationales, and discusses alternative ways to combine them in a faceted integrated classification scheme.\n",
      "knowledge organization research has come to question the theoretical distinction between aboutness (a document's innate content) and meaning (the use to which a document is put). this distinction has relevance beyond information studies, particularly in relation to homosexual concerns. literary criticism, in particular, frequently addresses the question: when is a work about homosexuality? this paper explores this literary debate and its implications for the design of subject access systems for gay and lesbian communities. by examining the literary criticism of herman melville's billy budd, particularly in relation to the theories of eve kosofsky sedgwick in the epistemology of the closet (1990), this paper exposes three tensions that designers of gay and lesbian classifications and vocabularies can expect to face. first is a tension between essentialist and constructivist views of homosexuality, which will affect the choice of terms, categories, and references. second is a tension between minoritizing and universalizing perspectives on homosexuality. third is a redefined distinction between aboutness and meaning, in which aboutness refers not to stable document content, but to the system designer's inescapable social and ideological perspectives. designers of subject access systems can therefore expect to work in a context of intense scrutiny and persistent controversy\n",
      "the comparative evaluation of different mechanized information systems continues to constitute a controversial topic in the literature. diametrically different opinions, seemingly corroborated through empirical evidence, have been presented since the time of the cranfield experiments. similar situations have often been encountered in the history of science if reasoning has exclusively been based on empiricism. in the information scientific field, several empirical laws have been formulated, for example that of the alledgedly inverse precision-recall relationship in information retrieval, of the assumed direct relationship between consistency and quality of indexing, and of the alledged equivalence of automatic with intellectual indexing. empiricism is seen as only another variation of positivism, which has been abandoned in the natural sciences since the middle of this century for its evident inadequacy, but has latently survived in information science and even now dominates here. here, it constitutes a source of continual confusion and an impediment to progress. for literally anything an empirical proof can be submitted provided that suitable examples are selected and methods are chosen. substantial advance in library and information science requires abandoning empiricism. budd's hermeneutic phenomenology seems to constitute a promising substitute (1995).\n",

      "works are key entities in the universe of recorded knowledge. works are those deliberate creations (known variously as opera, oeuvres, werke, etc.) that constitute individual sets of created conceptions that stand as the formal records of knowledge. in the information retrieval domain, the work as opposed to the document, has only recently received focused attention. in this paper, the definition of the work as an entity for information retrieval is examined. a taxonomic definition (that is, a definition built around a taxonomy) is presented. an epistemological perspective aids in understanding the components of the taxonomic definition. works, thus defined as entities for information retrieval, are seen to constitute sets of varying instantiations of abstract creations. these variant instantiations must be explicitly identified in future systems for documentary information retrieval. an expanded perception of works, such as that presented in this paper, helps us understand the variety of ways in which mechanisms for their control and retrieval might better be shaped in future.\n",

      "the general concern of bazerman's book shaping written knowledge. the genre and activity of the experimental article in science is written knowledge as it is produced by the academy. bazerman discusses in particular the rhetoric, communicative, and epistemological issues of written knowledge. the article discusses these themes in a library and information science (lis) perspective in terms of their implications for lis research. for several reasons, it is argued that this way of scrutinizing into written knowledge ought to be of special interest to lis research. as an example of a particular field of research in lis, the article discusses the relationship between indexing theory and written knowledge. bazerman analyzes written knowledge from a literary point of view. among other things, it is argued that indexing theory can be seen as part of literary theory in that some of the questions raised by the latter are also raised in indexing theory. furthermore, it is put forward that the indexer can be considered an author. the indexer produces a text, the document representation, which is the text the user actually meets in the first place. that way, the producer of a document representation is to some extent responsible for the quality of the documents indexed. having discussed this relationship between written knowledge and lis research in general and indexing theory in particular, it is concluded that lis research ought to head toward more humanistic oriented research traditions, if the line of research presented by bazerman should be considered useful for lis.\n",

      "a problem facing information retrieval and exchange among international medical practitioners and researchers is the lack of a knowledge structure or conceptual framework that relates concepts used in the western medical system to those used in non-western medical systems. this paper presents challenges we have encountered in attempting to develop a general conceptual framework to cover concepts and terminology used for information retrieval in the field of complementary and alternative medicine. this is a broad field that has not been covered appropriately in knowledge organization systems such as classification schemes, thesauri, and terminology databases. the objective of the project is to improve significantly the efficiency and the quality of cross-language and cross-cultural information exchange and knowledge discovery by facilitating concept mapping and information retrieval between western and eastern medical traditions. major facets of the conceptual framework include diagnostic categories, therapeutic preparations, human anatomy, selected diseases/medical conditions, and basics of traditional systems. the paper discusses issues of subject coverage, the representation of medical concepts in the conceptual framework, incorporation of concept names that have existed in individual traditional systems, and the relationships among concepts. findings reported are primarily from current work that focuses on traditional chinese medicine.\n",
      "natural text phrasing is an indeterminate process and, thus, inherently lacks representational predictability. this holds true in particular in the case of general concepts and of their syntactical connectivity. hence, natural language query phrasing and searching is an unending adventure of trial and error and, in most cases, has an unsatisfactory outcome with respect to the recall and precision ratios of the responses. human indexing is based on knowledgeable document interpretation and aims - among other things - at introducing predictability into the representation of documents. due to the indeterminacy of natural language text phrasing and image construction, any adequate indexing is also indeterminate in nature and therefore inherently defies any satisfactory algorithmization. but human indexing suffers from a different set of deficiencies which are absent in the processing of non-interpreted natural language. an optimally effective information system combines both types of language in such a manner that their specific strengths are preserved and their weaknesses are avoided. if the goal is a large and enduring information system for more than merely known-item searches, the expenditure for an advanced index language and its knowledgeable and careful employment is unavoidable.\n",

      "the study: functional requirements for bibliographic records (frbr) (specifications fonctionnelles des notices bibliographiques) was commissioned by ifla and published in 1998. it defines the core functions of a catalogue (and bibliographic records) as a gateway to information. for that purpose an abstract entity-relationship model of a catalogue is proposed. the frbr model is revolutionary. the (computer) catalogue is not seen as a sequence of bibliographic records and a replica of the traditional card catalogue, but rather as a network of connected entities, enabling the user to perform seamlessly all the necessary functions. so far there has been some theoretical discussion of the model and some limited experiments, but there is a lack of research in how to implement this theoretical model in practice, in new-generation catalogues. in this paper some reactions to the model are analysed. the main focus is on consequences of the model for the opac interface design, particularly the searching functionality and display of results.\n",
      "the physical organisation of items on library shelves using any classification scheme is inevitably a compromise. the best efforts to achieve an arrangement char is helpful to users will be thwarted by the multifaceted nature of these items and the specific needs of the user and the library. items on a particular subject will be scattered throughout the library building(s) across disciplines, by physical form, by frequency of use and whether and for how long they may be borrowed. even though the rich information content of multifaceted items may be represented in the notation, the items required by a user will be scattered across library shelves when the item is placed in a single relative location. this paper explores these issues using examples from a university library classified using the dea ey decimal classification scheme (ddc). the electronic context of the library opac can transcend the constraints imposed by the predominantly physical nature of library collections, yet the current use of classification schemes in on-line systems retains many of these limitations. examples of such systems applying ddc on the world wide web are discussed and compared with a system that seeks to use ddc in what is called view-based searching. the interface and the resulting browsing and searching capability of a view-based online public access catalogue (opac) are described. ways in which subject. access to library collections can be improved and disciplinary scatter resolved by assigning multiple class numbers to items and exploiting the rich dewey structure in a faceted form are discussed. it is suggested that the informative power of visual classificatory structures at the search interface will be beneficial to the broader learning experience of the user. the paper concludes that the application of classification schemes in electronic interfaces should not be bound by the physical constraints that no longer apply in an electronic context but be exploited to provide a complete, flexible and individual interface as determined by the needs of each user.\n",
      "the ways in which notation can be used to express the content of documents to which it relates are various. at the most superficial level notation can correspond to the hierarchical structure of the schedules or link to literal components. the notation of compound concepts can express the structure and composition of the compound, and systems exist in which symbols denote the functional roles of the constituent elements and the relationships between them. at the highest level notation can be used to mirror the actual structure of those entities which it represents, as in the case of mathematical systems or chemical compounds. methods of displaying these structures are examined, and the practicality in a documentary context is questioned, with particular reference to recent revision work on the chemistry class of the bliss bibliographic classification 2nd edition (bc2).\n",

      "work centered design of classification schemes is an emerging area of research which poses particular challenges to domain analysis and scheme construction. a key challenge in work centered design of classification schemes is the evolving semantics of work. this article introduces a work centered approach to the design of classification schemes, based on the framework of cognitive work analysis. we launch collaborative task situations as a new unit of analysis for capturing evolving semantic structures in work domains. an example case from a cognitive work analysis of three national film research archives illustrates the application of the framework for identifying actors' needs for a classification scheme to support collaborative knowledge integration. it is concluded that a main contribution of the new approach is support for empirical analysis and overall design of classification schemes that can serve as material interfaces for actors' negotiations and integration of knowledge perspectives during collaborative work.\n",
      "the main objective of an information retrieval system (irs) is to provide relevant information in response to the user's query. on the one part, the relevance of a response concerns its exactness compared with the user's query, on the other part, it concerns its correspondence with the user's knowledge level and his preferences. one of the major contributions in this area of personalization of the system's response is by taking into consideration each user's specificity. we propose the use of explicit user model where the system's solution will be determined by the knowledge of the user. the user's activities are recorded as documents. the method we adopt for information retrieval combines query by criteria and information analysis. we have also proposed architecture for cooperative information retrieval. this architecture allows two users to share their experience in the process information retrieval and for the interpretation of the system's result, on distant machines. the proposals were implemented in two systems: streems and metiore. streems manages information on trees while metiore manages information on bibliographic references.\n",
      "in a scientific and technological watch (stw) task, an expert user needs to survey the evolution of research topics in his area of specialization in order to detect interesting changes. the majority of methods proposing evaluation metrics (bibliometrics and scientometrics studies) for stw rely solely on statistical data analysis methods (co-citation analysis, co-word analysis). such methods usually work on structured databases where the units of analysis (words, keywords) are already attributed to documents by human indexers. the advent of huge amounts of unstructured textual data has rendered necessary the integration of natural language processing (nlp) techniques to first extract meaningful units from texts. we propose a method for stw which is nlp-oriented. the method not only analyses texts linguistically in order to extract terms from them, but also uses linguistic relations (syntactic variations) as the basis for clustering. terms and variation relations are formalised as weighted di-graphs which the clustering algorithm, cpcl (classification by preferential clustered link) will seek to reduce in order to produce classes. these classes ideally represent the research topics present in the corpus. the results of the classification are subjected to validation by an expert in stw.\n",
      "this article is organized in 10 sections: (1) knowledge organization (ko) is a wide interdisciplinary field, much broader than library and information science (lis). (2) inside lis there have been many different approaches and traditions of ko with little mutual influence. these traditions have to a large extent been defined by new technology, for which reason the theoretical integration and underpinning has not been well considered. the most important technology-driven traditions are: a) manual indexing and classification in libraries and reference works, b) documentation and scientific communication, c) information storage and retrieval by computers, d) citation based ko and e) full text, hypertext and internet based approaches. these traditions taken together define very much the special lis focus on ko. for ko as a field of research it is important to establish a fruitful theoretical frame of reference for this overall field. this paper provides some suggestions. (3) one important, theoretical distinction to consider is the one between social and intellectual forms of ko. social forms of ko are related to professional training, disciplines and social groups while intellectual organization is related to concepts and theories in the fields to be organized. (4) the social perspective includes in addition the systems of genres and documents as well as the social system of knowledge producers, knowledge intermediaries and knowledge users. (5) this social system of documents, genres and agents makes available a very complicated structure of potential subject access points (saps), which may be used in information retrieval (ir). the basic aim of research in ko is to develop knowledge on how to optimise this system of saps and its utilization in ir. (6) saps may be seen as signs, and their production and use may be understood from a social semiotic point of view. (7) the concept of paradigms is also helpful because different groups and interests tend to be organized according to a paradigm and to develop different criteria of relevance, and thus different criteria of likeliness in ko. (8) the basic unit in ko is the semantic relation between two concepts, and such relations are embedded in theories. (9) in classification like things are grouped together, but what is considered similar is not a trivial question. (10) the paper concludes with the considering of methods for ko. basically the methods of any field are connected with epistemological theories. this is also the case with ko. the existing methods as described in the literature of ko fit into a classification of basic epistemological views. the debate about the methods of ko at the deepest level therefore implies an epistemological discussion.\n",
      "this philosophical essay explores the epistemological foundations of knowledge organization and discusses implications for classification research. the study defines the concept of knowledge, distinguishes between subjective knowledge (i.e., knowledge as a thought in the individual's mind) and objective knowledge (i.e., knowledge as an independent object), establishes the necessity of knowledge organization in the construction of knowledge and its key role in the creation, learning, and dissemination of knowledge, and concludes with implications for the development of classification schemes and knowledge maps.\n",
      "a book number takes shelf arrangement of documents to a point where classification per se cannot. class number alone is not able to uniquely indivdiualise a document on the library shelves. the function of a book number starts from where that of the class number ends. an author number also brings together all the books by one author in one specific subject. a chronological book number will clearly portray the development of a subject over a given period. book numbers are indispensable for a shelflist. the national library (nl) of india at kolkata has a collection of about 3 million documents. for organizing its contents it uses the ddc and the shelf arrangement is by cutter's three figure author table. for indian names it uses its home-made author table described here. though the national library table is designed especially for indian names across all religions and regional cultures, yet its use outside the national library has not been reported mostly due lack of marketing. since 1961 the indian cultural names have undergone many changes. the need is to revise and update the table to reflect the current culture and new authors across india.\n",

      "this investigation was undertaken to explore the prospect of using the repertory grid structured interview technique as a tool for creating metadata. the following question is considered: could repertory grid technique be used as a tool in the creation of metadata? it is postulated that repertory grid technique may be used as a tool for creating metadata labels, or tags, where the labels or tags describe entities, which may be images, documents or expressions. repertory grid technique can provide a method for examining the detail about an individual's mental models, or personal construct systems of lifeworld entities, which may include images, documents or expressions. the question were considered by looking at the results of an earlier study, which explored the personal constructs of systems analysts using the repertory grid technique to examine the mental conceptualizations that determine the extent of difference in conceptualization. categorical core areas of expressions used during software requirements development emerge through classification of the conceptualizations of expressions elicited via the repertory grid interviews. repertory grid also reveals, through cluster analysis, the subtle difference in the way each participant conceptually related one expression to another expression. the differences in conceptual relationship of expressions or concepts could represent insight about how people view entities of a lifeworld. in a situation where metadata are used to label entities of a lifeworld for organization and retrieval of information, the differences in conceptual relationships might influence the metadata created and how they are used in the lifeworld for the organization and retrieval of information.\n",

      "the organisation of knowledge for exploitation and re-use in the modern enterprise is often a most perplexing challenge. the entire knowledge management life-cycle (for example - create, capture, organize, store, search, and transfer) is impacted by the organisation of intellectual capital into a corporate taxonomy or at the least a knowledge map (often incorrectly used interchangeably). determining the extent to which such an objective is achieved is the focus of what is known as a knowledge audit. in this practice-oriented article, the authors review the fundamentals of creating a taxonomy, the use of meta-data in a necessary process known as classification and the role of expertise locators where the knowledge is not explicit but resides within experts in the form of tacit knowledge. the authors conclude with a framework for developing a corporate taxonomy and how such a project may be executed. the conceptual contribution of this article is the postulation that corporate taxonomies that are designed to facilitate knowledge audits lead to greater organizational impact.\n",
      "knowledge organization systems (kos) can be described based on their structures (from flat to multidimensional) and main functions. the latter include eliminating ambiguity, controlling synonyms or equivalents, establishing explicit semantic relationships such as hierarchical and associative relationships, and presenting both relationships and properties of concepts in the knowledge models. examples of kos include lists, authority files, gazetteers, synonym rings, taxonomies and classification schemes, thesauri, and ontologies. these systems model the underlying semantic structure of a domain and provide semantics, navigation, and translation through labels, definitions, typing, relationships, and properties for concepts. the term knowledge organization systems (kos) is intended to encompass all types of schemes for organizing information and promoting knowledge management, such as classification schemes, gazetteers, lexical databases, taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies (hodge 2000). these systems model the underlying semantic structure of a domain and provide semantics, navigation, and translation through labels, definitions, typing, relationships, and properties for concepts (hill et al. 2002, koch and tudhope 2004). embodied as (web) services, they facilitate resource discovery and retrieval by acting as semantic road maps, thereby making possible a common orientation for indexers and future users, either human or machine (koch and tudhope 2003, 2004).\n",
      "critical race theory is introduced as a potentially useful approach to the evaluation of bibliographic classification schemes. an overview is presented of the essential elements of critical race theory, including clarifications of the meanings of some important terms such as “race” and “social justice.” on the basis of a review of existing conceptions of the just and the antiracist library service, a rationale is presented for hypothesizing that critical race theory may be of use to the library and information sciences. the role of classification schemes as information institutions in their own right is established, and the dewey decimal classification is introduced as the case to be studied. the challenges faced by classification-scheme designers in the construction and/or reconstruction of race-related categories are reviewed; and an analysis is presented of one sense in which it might be suggested that recent (2003) revisions in one of the ddc’s tables appear not to meet those challenges wholly successfully. an account is given of a further sense in which adoption of a critical race-theoretic approach has the more radical effect of calling into question a fundamental decision recently taken to “deracialize” the ddc. in conclusion, an assessment is made of critical race theory as a framework for evaluating library classification schemes.\n",
      "the paper gives a short overview of the history of use of udc in internet subject gateways (sgs) with an english interface, from 1993 to 2006. there were in total, nine quality controlled sgs that were functional for shorter or longer periods of time. their typology and functionality is described. quality sgs have evolved and the role of classification has changed accordingly from supporting subject organization on the interface and automatic categorization of resources, towards supporting a semantic linking, control and vocabulary mapping between different indexing systems in subject hubs and federated sgs. in this period, many sgs ceased to exist and little information remains available regarding their status. sgs currently using udc, for some part of their resource organization, do not use a udc subject hierarchy at the interface and its role in resource indexing has become more difficult to observe. since 2000, udc has become more prevalent in east european sgs, portals and hubs, which are outside the scope of this research. this paper is an attempt to provide a record on this particular application of udc and to offer some consideration of the changes in requirements when it comes to the use of library classification in resource discovery.\n",
      "using a qualitative research method, in this study we investigated the attributes and factors that might affect the organization of knowledge resources in the library and information service industry. the findings from this study suggest that, in addition to \"document/content\" attributes (i.e., author, title, subject, etc.) traditionally emphasized by the library and information science field, the library and information service industry may also take \"disposition,\" \"situation,\" and \"order/scheme\" attributes as additional standards for organizing knowledge resources.\n",
      "governing the professional and intellectual potential is an interdisciplinary field of scientific research using a systematic process of developing innovation technologies for transforming individual knowledge and specialists' experience in such a way that would apply the knowledge and experience to the processes, services and products offered by an organization to reach its strategic goals. from the technological standpoint, governing the professional and intellectual potential represents modeling, forming, using and developing the corporate system of governing the professional and intellectual potential. we consider structuring knowledge using this model rather valuable during the stage of forming the governance system of professional and intellectual potential. understanding, i.e., explicit definition of these factors, would allow for constant observation of the behavioral trends and for organizing the activity in a way conducive for influencing the favorable change of these factors. in addition, the presence of the critical management factor (cmf) system enables one to check the significance of any activity (i.e., any processes within a company) against these factors.\n",
      "the research dynamics of knowledge organization (ko) show a tendency towards the reformulation of previous questions in the new technology-driven and interdisciplinary context of ko. current research questions in ko are dominated by a noteworthy interest in quality, related not only to the informational contents recorded in knowledge organization systems (kos) but also to technical and technological considerations. the integration of knowledge would seem to constitute a quality indicator present in most proposals, and it also responds to the need for kos with frameworks comprehensible for all user sectors, respecting the diversity of users. the flip side of knowledge integration entails the conjugation of technical, formal and technological aspects, well represented by the word interoperability, or the search for a way to simplify and harmonize the great variety of structures and formats that coexist in the internet. this paper addresses the aforementioned major research concerns expressed in the last decade of ko literature. it is structured into two broad sections: 1) a demand for quality, touching on research questions related to multilingualism, cross-culturalism, social groups, minorities and ethics, as well as the integration of structures, forms and formats and the respective proposals by scholars; and 2) a demand for managing emergent knowledge in kos, with a discussion of how to represent and organize work-oriented and organizational knowledge domains, where multidimensional knowledge (multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinarity) is addressed together with the responses put forth by various researchers.\n",
      "relationships that interconnect entity classes of import to knowledge organization (knowledge, documents, concepts, beings, information needs, language) include both non-subject bibliographic relationships (document-to-document relationships, responsibility relationships) and conceptual content relationships (subject relationships, relevance relationships). while the marc format allows the recording of most bibliographic relationships, many of them are not expressed systematically. conceptual content relationships include, in turn, interconcept and intraconcept relationships. the expression of interconcept relationships is covered by standard thesaural relationships, which typically do not distinguish fully between the underlying lexical relationship types. the full expression of complex intraconcept relationships includes indication of the basic nature of the relationship (including a set of semantic roles), the set of entities that participate in the relationship, and a mapping between participants and semantic roles. knowledge organization schemes seldom express these relationships fully.\n",
      "while taxonomies are being increasingly discussed in published and grey literature, the term taxonomy still seems to be stated quite loosely and obscurely. this paper aims at explaining and clarifying the concept of taxonomy in the context of information organization. to this end, the salient features of taxonomies are identified and their scope, nature, and role are further elaborated based on an extensive literature review. in the meantime, the connection and distinctions between taxonomies and classification schemes and thesauri are also identified, and the rationale that taxonomies are chosen as a viable knowledge organization system used in organization-wide websites to support browsing and aid navigation is clarified.\n",
      "folksonomy, a free-form tagging, is a user-generated classification system of web contents that allows users to tag their favorite web resources with their chosen words or phrases selected from natural language. these tags (also called concepts, categories, facets or entities) can be used to classify web resources and to express users' preferences. folksonomy-based systems allow users to classify web resources through tagging bookmarks, photos or other web resources and saving them to a public web site like del.icio.us. thus information about web resources and online articles can be shared in an easy way. the purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the folksonomy tagging phenomenon (also called social tagging and social bookmarking) and explore some of the reasons why we need controlled vocabularies, discussing the problems associated with folksonomy.\n",
      "the recent experiences in the building, maintenance and reuse of ontologies has shown that the most efficient approach is the collaborative one. however, communication between collaborators such as it professionals, librarians, web designers and subject matter experts is difficult and time consuming. this is because there are different reasoning strategies, different logics and different kinds of knowledge representation in the applications of semantic web. this article intends to be a reference scheme. it uses concise and simple explanations that can be used in common by specialists of different backgrounds working together in an application of semantic web.\n",
      "we analyze the scientific discourse of researchers in a specialty field in astronomy by examining the influence that geographic location may have on the development of this field. using as a case study the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) pro- ject, we analyzed texts from bibliographic records along three geographic axes: us-only publications, non-us publications and international collaboration. each geographic region reflected authors affiliated to research institutions in that region. interna- tional collaboration refers to papers published by both us-based and non-us based institutions. through clustering of domain terms used in titles and abstracts fields of the bibliographic records, we were able to automatically identify the topology of to- pics peculiar to each geographic region and identify the research topics common to the three geographic zones. the results showed that us-only and non-us research in sdss shared more commonalities with international collaboration than with one another, thus indicating that the former two focused on rather distinct topics.\n",
      "in isko's name, the term \"knowledge organization\" (ko) denotes already the object and the activity area significant for the existence of any science. both areas are outlined and their specific contents shown. also a survey of its special subfields is given. the science-theoretical foundation of knowledge organization as a new scientific discipline is based on the propositional concept of science. within a universal system of the sciences, ko has been regarded as a subfield of science of science. concludingly it is proposed to find the necessary institution for work in concerted effort of scientists, knowledge organizers and terminologists on the collection, definition, and systematization of concepts of all subject fields, utilizing the information coding classification (icc) as the necessary categorizing structure.\n",
      "this paper surveys classification research literature, discusses various classification theories, and shows that the focus has traditionally been on establishing a scientific foundation for classification research. this paper argues that a shift has taken place, and suggests that contemporary classification research focus on contextual information as the guide for the design and construction of classification schemes.\n",
      "in this paper, i point to the importance of an often neglected objectivist strand in paul otlet's (1868-1944) thinking: his linguistic objectivism. linguistic objectivism consists in the view that linguistic atoms uniquely correspond to certain discrete and well-defined elements in the world and further combinations of these linguistic atoms can objectively capture \"the order of the world\". this analysis tempers some of the past claims on the influence of positivism on otlet.\n",
      "a thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary designed to allow for effective information retrieval. it consists of different kinds of semantic relationships, with the aim of guiding users to the choice of the most suitable index and search terms for expressing a certain concept. the relational semantics of a thesaurus deal with methods to connect terms with related meanings and are intended to enhance information recall capabilities. in this paper, focused on hierarchical relations, different aspects of the relational semantics of thesauri, and among them the possibility of developing richer structures, are analyzed. thesauri are viewed as semantic tools providing, for operational purposes, the representation of the meaning of the terms. the paper stresses how theories of semantics, holding different perspectives about the nature of meaning and how it is represented, affect the design of the relational semantics of thesauri. the need for tools capable of representing the complexity of knowledge and of the semantics of terms as it occurs in the literature of their respective subject fields is advocated. it is underlined how this would contribute to improving the retrieval of information. to achieve this goal, even though in a preliminary manner, we explore the possibility of setting against the framework of thesaurus design the notions of language games and hermeneutic horizon.\n",
      "the underground railroad was a network of people who helped fugitive slaves escape to the north and canada during the u.s. civil war period, beginning in about 1831.quilting was used as a form of information representation (breneman 2001). this simple classification was designed to relate the symbolic transmission of escape routes and locations of sanctuary. because it was for use in a children's library, symbolic representations were used to anchor the classes. symbols are based in the african graphic arts, the adinkra symbols of ghana (west african wisdom. 2001), and also from actual quilt practice (threads of freedom 2001 and breneman 2001).\n",
      "the purpose of information visualization (infoviz) is to show information graphically. that purpose is often obscured by infoviz designs that are not well understood in practice. this paper offers an overview of infoviz culled from the literature on applications of information visualization for the digital library: how the clustering works that creates the topics, and how those topics are represented graphically. a taxonomy of infoviz designs in one, two and three dimensions is presented. it is suggested that user evaluations of infoviz designs might be used to enrich infoviz theory and, whether through application of the theory or through application of user remarks, developers might improve infoviz interface comprehensibility. design recommendations are made in an effort to improve weaknesses and capitalize on strengths of present interfaces in representing knowledge visually.\n",
      "the use of graphical representations is very common in information technology and engineering. although these same tools could be applied effectively in other areas, they are not used because they are hardly known or are completely unheard of. this article aims to discuss the results of the experimentation carried out on graphical approaches to knowledge representation during research, analysis and problem-solving in the health care sector. the experimentation was carried out on conceptual mapping and petri nets, developed collaboratively online with the aid of the cmaptool and woped graphic applications. two distinct professional communities have been involved in the research, both pertaining to the local health units in tuscany. one community is made up of head physicians and health care managers whilst the other is formed by technical staff from the department of nutrition and food hygiene. it emerged from the experimentation that concept maps are considered more effective in analyzing knowledge domain related to the problem to be faced (description of what it is). on the other hand, petri nets are more effective in studying and formalizing its possible solutions (description of what to do to). for the same reason, those involved in the experimentation have proposed the complementary rather than alternative use of the two knowledge representation methods as a support for professional problem-solving.\n",
      "the essence of folksonomies is user-created descriptive metadata as opposed to the traditional sender-determined descriptive metadata in taxonomies and faceted classification. we briefly introduce the beginning and principles of folksonomy and discuss the categorizing concept of folksonomies on the basis of the computer program delicious. the selection of the metadata tagged is not accidental, rather tagging follows a pattern that proves to be the pattern for the classic power law, which, in many complex systems is seen to unfold as an imitation-dynamic that creates an asymmetry, where a few descriptive metadata are often reproduced and the majority seldom reproduced. in del.icio.us, it is the very broadband basic subject headings that are often reproduced and achieve power in the system - which in cognitive psychology is called cognitive basic categories - while the small, more specific subject headings are seldom reproduced. the law of power's underlying imitation-dynamic in del.icio.us is explained from the perspective of different theoretical paradigms, i.e. network, economy and cognition. the theorectical and speculative conclusion is that the law of power and asymmetry is biased by a cognitive economizing through a simplification principle in the users' construction of descriptive metadata. free tagging in folksonomies is comparable to empirical experiments in free categorization. users often choose broad basic categories, because that requires the least cognitive effort. the consequences are that folksonomy is not necessarily a better, more realistic and cheaper method of creating metadata than that which can be generated through taxonomies, faceted classification or search algorithms. folksonomy as a self-organizing system likely cannot create better and cheaper descriptive metadata.\n",
      "i present a detailed philosophical study of three classification systems: al-farabi, al-ghazali and ibn khaldun. the primary aim of this study is to formulate the underlying philosophical basis of each classification and to relate this basis to certain principles contained in the islamic revelation. i also give analytical treatment of the following questions: the major distinguishing features of each classification and the attitude of each thinker towards the philosophical and religious sciences and how they envisaged the distinction between the two fields.\n",
      "this is a comparative analysis of the term ontology, used in the computer science domain, with the term thesaurus, used in the information science domain. the aim of the study is to establish the main convergence points of these two knowledge representation instruments and to point out their differences. in order to fulfill this goal an analytical-synthetic method was applied to extract the meaning underlying each of the selected definitions of the instruments. the definitions were obtained from texts well accepted by the research community from both areas. the definitions were applied to a kwic system in order to rotate the terms that were examined qualitatively and quantitatively. we concluded that thesauri and ontologies operate at the same knowledge level, the epistemological level, in spite of different origins and purposes.\n",
      "when assigning subject headings or index terms to a document, how many terms or phrases should be used to represent the document? the contribution of an indexing phrase to locating and ordering documents can be compared to the contribution of a full-text query to finding documents. the length and number of phrases needed to equal the contribution of a full-text query is the subject of this paper. the appropriate number of phrases is determined in part by the length of the phrases. we suggest several rules that may be used to determine how many subject headings should be assigned, given index phrase lengths, and provide a general model for this process. a difference between characteristics of indexing hard science and social science literature is suggested.\n",
      "abstract: classification schemes, thesauri, taxonomies, and other controlled vocabularies play important roles in the or-ganization and retrieval of information in many different environments. while the design and construction of controlled vo-cabularies have been prescribed at the technical level in great detail over the past decades, the methodological level has been somewhat neglected. however, classification research has in recent years focused on developing approaches to the analysis of users, domains, and activities that could produce requirements for the design of controlled vocabularies. researchers have of-ten argued that the design, construction, and use of controlled vocabularies need to be based on analyses and understandings of the contexts in which these controlled vocabularies function. while one would assume that the growing body of research on human information behavior might help guide the development of controlled vocabularies shed light on these contexts, unfor-tunately, much of the research in this area is descriptive in nature and of little use for systems design. this paper discusses these trends and outlines a holistic approach that demonstrates how the design of controlled vocabularies can be informed by inves-tigations of people’s interactions with information. this approach is based on the cognitive work analysis framework and outlines several dimensions of human-information interactions. application of this approach will result is a comprehensive un-derstanding of the contexts in which the controlled vocabulary will function and which can be used for the development of for the development of controlled vocabularies.\n",
      "the scholarly community is increasingly employing the web both for publication of scholarly output and for locating and accessing relevant scholarly literature. organization of this vast body of digital information assumes significance in this context. the sheer volume of digital information to be handled makes traditional indexing and knowledge representation strategies ineffective and impractical. it is, therefore, worth exploring new approaches. an approach being discussed considers the intrinsic semantics of texts of documents. based on the hypothesis that noun phrases in a text are semantically rich in terms of their ability to represent the subject content of the document, this approach seeks to identify and extract noun phrases instead of single keywords, and use them as descriptors. this paper presents a methodology that has been developed for extracting noun phrases from portuguese texts. the results of an experiment carried out to test the adequacy of the methodology are also presented.\n",
      "this study presents a methodology for compiling corpus-based learner's glossaries designed for non-specialist translators and language for specific purposes (lsp) learners. the need for such bilingual microglossaries on subsections of a subject field for lsp teaching and translation purposes is emphasized in the introduction. the concept\"learner's glossary' is delimited among other types of terminological collections such as a specialised dictionary, a thesaurus and a term bank in section 2 where the information categories in an entry are specified (keyterm plus translation equivalent(s), definition of keyterm and exemplary context, narrower terms with synonyms, definitions and translation equivalents; special phrases based on keyterm collocations with translation equivalents and exemplary contexts). section 3 describes the principles and working methods of modern terminography as well as the source materials available for the glossary compilation. a hybrid term extraction technique is also described in that section and is used to extract the candidate terms with subsequent manual initial processing of the results. in section 4 the theoretical grounds and methodology for analysing the conceptual relations in a terminological system are presented including the expert validation of the automatically extracted terms as a first phase in that process. rationale for applying a lexico-semantic analysis in identifying collocational information on the keyterms is provided in section 5 which is proposed to involve descriptions of the actantial structure of a keyterm for identifying verbal (t+v) collocations and of the paradigmatic and syntagmatic morpho-syntactic relations applicable to a keyterm. finally, a model for structuring a learner's glossary entry is proposed in section 6.\n",
      "information science, which attained the status of a discipline in the 1980s, has been enriched by inputs from a number of disciplines ranging from computer technology to psychology. a predominant characteristic of research in information retrieval (ir) in recent years has been the adoption of a 'user-centered' approach to the design of information systems. this shift in the emphasis began primarily after belkin enunciated his ask (anomalous state of knowledge) hypothesis. research in the cognitive sciences has the potential to contribute substantially to enhancing all information retrieval processes. this paper emphasizes the importance of adopting a broad-based approach to cognitive research in ir and suggests that there is a need for exploring the relevance of analytico-synthetic approach and related research in the design of ir systems.\n",
      "this study is an investigation of whether learners' knowledge is organized around a \"core\" concept within a knowledge domain, which is strongly linked to other secondary concepts, called \"anchored concepts.\" in other words, the \"core\" concept and \"anchored\" concept are mutually supportive of one another. these two concepts can be linked with other concepts to produce more extended and robust knowledge structures in memory. this study used a flow map method to identify learner's \"core\" and \"anchored\" concepts derived from the treatment instruction about thermal physics. the results showed that with the assistance of \"core\" concept, profitably mediated by the \"anchored\" concept, learners could recall more extended knowledge, with greater richness and with higher connection than in the absence of this organizing information (experiment 1). however, the difference between the provision of a group core concept and an individual core concept did not reach any significance level in the recall task two-month later (experiment 2). when the recall task was carried out six months later, the group \"anchored\" concept showed the essential assistance to the recall of knowledge (experiment 3). this study has provided potential insights not only about the functional mechanisms of learners' knowledge construction but also for classification research.\n",
      "this article reports on an empirical investigation into the information needs and information organization practices of small business enterprises in south africa. the purpose of the investigation was to determine what information should be taken into account when designing systems for organizing information in such businesses, and how these businesses actually organize their electronic documents. the investigation of the systems in use also presented the opportunity to gather business concepts that were used to construct a generic classification scheme for the purpose of information organization in small enterprises. data were gathered from 24 small businesses located in three different provinces by means of personal interviews with owners/managers, guided by a questionnaire, and through on-site observation of the information organization systems used. the results of the survey show what information is regarded as critically important in small businesses, and give insight into the current situation with regard to information organization in the businesses. recommendations are made for improving information organization in small businesses.\n",
      "ontology editors are software tools that allow the creation and maintenance of ontologies through a graphical user interface. as the semantic web effort grows, a larger community of users for this kind of tool is expected. new users include people not specifically skilled in the use of ontology formalisms. in consequence, the usability of ontology editors can be viewed as a key adoption precondition for semantic web technologies. in this paper, the usability evaluation of several representative ontology editors is described. this evaluation is carried out by combining a heuristic pre-assessment with a subsequent user-testing phase. the target population is comprised of people with no specific ontology-creation skills that have a general knowledge about domain modelling. for this kind of user, current editors are adequate for the creation and maintenance of simple ontologies. also, there is room for improvement, especially in browsing mechanisms, help systems, and visualization metaphors.\n",
      "knowledge organization (ko) is about activities such as document description, indexing and classification performed in libraries, databases, archives etc. these activities are done by librarians, archivists, subject specialists as well as by computer algorithms. ko as a field of study is concerned with the nature and quality of such knowledge organizing processes (kop) as well as the knowledge organizing systems (kos) used to organize documents, document representations and concepts. there exist different historical and theoretical approaches to and theories about ko, which are related to different views of knowledge, cognition, language, and social organization. each of these approaches tends to answer the question: \"what is knowledge organization?\" differently. lis professionals have often concentrated on applying new technology and standards, and may not have seen their work as involving interpretation and analysis of meaning. that is why library classification has been criticized for a lack of substantive intellectual content. traditional human-based activities are increasingly challenged by computer-based retrieval techniques. it is appropriate to investigate the relative contributions of different approaches; the current challenges make it imperative to reconsider this understanding. this paper offers an understanding of ko based on an explicit theory of knowledge.\n",
      "the purpose, scope, usage, methodology, cross-mapping and encoding of ontologies is summarized. a snapshot of current research and development includes available tools, ontologies, and query engines, with their applications. benefits, problems, and costs are discussed, and the feasibility and usefulness of ontologies is weighed with respect to potential and current digital library arenas. the author concludes that ontology application potentially has a huge impact within knowledge management, enterprise integration, e-commerce, and possibly education, outside of heavily funded domains, feasibility depends on assessment of various evolving factors, including the current tools and systems, level of adoption in the field, time and expertise available, and cost barriers.\n",
      "citation-chasing is proposed as a method of discovering additional terms to enhance subject-search retrieval by broadening and prioritizing the results. subjects attached to records representing cited works are compared to subjects attached to records representing the original citing sources, and to the subjects yielded by chasing see-also references from the latter group of headings. original citing sources were yielded via a subject-list search in a library catalog using the subject heading \"language and languages - origin.\" a subject-search was employed to avoid subjectivity in choosing sources. references from the sources were searched in oclc where applicable, and the subject headings were retrieved. the subjects were ranked first by number of citations from original sources, then by total citation-frequency. the results were tiered into four groups in a bradford-like distribution. a similar rank and division was performed on the subjects representing the original citing sources, and those yielded by chasing see-also references. both in terms of subject frequency and topic type, positive comparisons between citation-chasing and see-also references show a confirmation of different methods of yielding alternative subjects. exclusive results suggest potential mutual complementary value among these different methods.\n",

      "at the end of 2005, impending digitization efforts and several developments related to the creation of access and discovery tools for informational and cultural objects resulted in a series of responses that continue to ripple throughout the library, museum and archive communities. these developments have broad implications for all three communities because of the goals shared by each in the creation of description, control and enhanced access to informational and cultural objects. this position paper will consider new implementations of faceted navigation and browsing features in online catalogs. it is also a response to challenges to develop interwoven approaches to the study of information seeking and the design and implementation of search and discovery systems. urgently needed during this time of experimentation, development and implementation is a framework for system evaluation and critical analysis of needed and missing features that is grounded in traditional principles, borne out by practice. such a framework could extend feature analysis protocols established during the early years of online catalog development.\n",

(2) can the two basic approaches, ontological and epistemological, be reconciled? (3) can any ontological foundation of ko be identified? (4) should disciplines continue to be the structural base of ko? (5) how can viewpoint warrant be respected? (6) how can ko be adapted to local collection needs?

      "ontology, in its philosophical meaning, is the discipline investigating the structure of reality. its findings can be relevant to knowledge organization, and models of knowledge can, in turn, offer relevant ontological suggestions. several philosophers in time have pointed out that reality is structured into a series of integrative levels, like the physical, the biological, the mental, and the cultural, and that each level plays as a base for the emergence of more complex levels. more detailed theories of levels have been developed by nicolai hartmann and james k. feibleman, and these have been considered as a source for structuring principles in bibliographic classification by both the classification research group (crg) and ingetraut dahlberg. crg's analysis of levels and of their possible application to a new general classification scheme based on phenomena instead of disciplines, as it was formulated by derek austin in 1969, is examined in detail. both benefits and open problems in applying integrative levels to bibliographic classification are pointed out.\n",
      "the new term representation of knowledge, applied to the framework of electronic segments of information, with comprehension of new material support for information, and a review and total conceptualisation of the terminology which is being applied, entails a review of all traditional documentary practices. therefore, a definition of the concept of representation of knowledge is indispensable. the term representation has been used in western cultural and intellectual tradition to refer to the diverse ways that a subject comprehends an object. representation is a process which requires the structure of natural language and human memory whereby it is interwoven in a subject and in conscience. however, at the present time, the term representation of knowledge is applied to the processing of electronic information, combined with the aim of emulating the human mind in such a way that one has endeavoured to transfer, with great difficulty, the complex structurality of the conceptual representation of human knowledge to new digital information technologies. thus, nowadays, representation of knowledge has taken on diverse meanings and it has focussed, for the moment, on certain structures and conceptual hierarchies which carry and transfer information, and has initially been based on the current representation of knowledge using artificial intelligence. the traditional languages of documentation, also referred to as languages of representation, offer a structured representation of conceptual fields, symbols and terms of natural and notational language, and they are the pillars for the necessary correspondence between the object or text and its representation. these correspondences, connections and symbolisations will be established within the electronic framework by means of different models and of the goal domain, which will give rise to organisations, structures, maps, networks and levels, as new electronic documents are not compact units but segments of information. thus, the new representation of knowledge refers to data, images, figures and symbolised, treated, processed and structured ideas which replace or refer to documents within the framework of technical processing and the recuperation of electronic information.\n",

      "as the literature in both knowledge organization and knowledge management continues to flourish and address issues common to both fields, it becomes more difficult to delineate the boundaries of each discipline. by exploring the relationship between them, as well as the knowledge environment within which a knowledge management system must operate, it is clear that much of the functionality subsumed under the heading of knowledge management requires a strong knowledge organization foundation to support it. by understanding the differences between these two disciplines, as well as the areas of inquiry within knowledge organization that are essential to the successful implementation of knowledge management systems, a wide field of fruitful research directions becomes apparent for both knowledge organization and knowledge management researchers.\n",

      "several systems for the classification of fiction have been proposed to date, but experience shows that such classification partially depends on the culture and literary education in specific countries. slovenian public libraries have traditionally used udc as the only subject information on belles-lettres. research has shown that users would prefer richer subject information. therefore an attempt was made to enhance udc by adding subject information, that should be helpful to users and librarians. the newly proposed alternative model system contains lists of verbal and alpha-numerical denotations for the basic groups of belles-lettres book material (main-genres: lyrics, drama, epics) and all other categorical criteria (language of the original literary work, literature to which the work belongs, genre, sub-genre) and half-categorical (accessibility of the content of literary works, origin within the periods of literary history, the century in which the literary work was written, the rhythm of the language). all these lists are available, but not included in this paper. the idea of the alternative model system is to show the possibilities of making the classification of belles-lettres in libraries more helpful, efficient and exact.\n",

      "this paper is a current assessment of the status of metadata creation and mapping between cataloger-defined field names and dublin core (dc) metadata elements across three digital image collections. the metadata elements that evince the most frequently inaccurate, inconsistent and incomplete dc metadata application are identified. as well, the most frequently occurring locally added metadata elements and associated pattern development are examined. for this, a randomly collected sample of 659 metadata item records from three digital image collections is analyzed. implications and issues drawn from the evaluation of the current status of metadata creation and mapping are also discussed in relation to the issue of semantic interoperability of concept representation across digital image collections. the findings of the study suggest that conceptual ambiguities and semantic overlaps inherent among some dc metadata elements hinder semantic interoperability. the dc metadata scheme needs to be refined in order to disambiguate semantic relations of certain dc metadata elements that present semantic overlaps and conceptual ambiguities between element names and their corresponding definitions. the findings of the study also suggest that the development of mediation mechanisms such as concept networks that facilitate the metadata creation and mapping process are critically needed for enhancing metadata quality.\n",

      "in the last two decades of knowledge organization (ko) research, there has been an increasing interest in the context-dependent nature of human knowledge. contextualism maintains that knowledge is not available in a neutral and objective way, but is always interwoven with the process of knowledge production and the prerequisites of the knower. as a first step towards a systematic organization of epistemic contexts, the concept of knowledge will be considered in its onto- logical (what) and epistemological (who) including methodological (how) dimensions. in current ko research, however, either the contextualism is not fully implemented (classification-as-ontology) or the ambition for a context-transcending universal kos seems to have been abandoned (classification-as-epistemology). based on a combined ontology and epistemology it will be argued that a phenom- ena-based approach to ko as stipulated by the leon manifesto, for example, requires a revision of the underlying phenomenon concept as a relation between the known object (what) and the knowing subject (who), which is constituted by the application of specific meth- ods (how). while traditional subject indexing of documents often relies on the organizing principle \"levels of being\" (what), for a fu- ture context indexing, two novel principles are proposed, namely \"levels of knowing\" (who) and \"integral methodological pluralism\" (how).\n",

      "the findings of a recent study on digital archival representation raise some ethical concerns about how digital archival materials are organized, described, and made available for use on the web. archivists have a fundamental obligation to preserve and protect the authenticity and integrity of records in their holdings and, at the same time, have the responsibility to promote the use of records as a fundamental purpose of the keeping of archives (saa 2005 code of ethics for archivists v & vi). is it an ethical practice that digital content in digital archives is deeply embedded in its contextual structure and generally underrepresented in digital archival systems? similarly, is it ethical for archivists to detach digital items from their archival context in order to make them more \"digital friendly\" and more accessible to meet needs of some users? do archivists have an obligation to bring the two representation systems together so that the context and content of digital archives can be better represented and archival materials \"can be located and used by anyone, for any purpose, while still remaining authentic evidence of the work and life of the creator\"?

      "social tagging systems, known as ‘folksonomies’, represent an important part of web resource discovery as they enable free and unrestricted browsing through information space. folksonomies consisting of subject designators (tags) assigned by users, however, have one important drawback: they do not express semantic relationships either hierarchical or associative between tags. as a consequence, the use of tags to browse information resources requires moving from one resource to another, based on coincidence and not on the pre-established meaningful or logical connections that may exist between related resources. we suggest that the semantic structure of the universal decimal classification (udc) may be used in complementing and supporting tag-based browsing. in this work, two specific questions were investigated: (1) are terms used as tags in folksonomies included in the udc? and (2) which facets of udc match the characteristics of documents or information objects that are tagged in folksonomies? a collection of the most popular tags from amazon, librarything, delicious and 43things was investigated. the universal nature of udc was examined through the universality of topics and facets covering diverse human interests which are at the same time interconnected and form a rich and intricate semantic structure. the results suggest that udc-supported folksonomies could be implemented in resource discovery, in particular in library portals and catalogues.\n",

      "in 2009 isko had its 20 th anniversary, a time for review and reflection on what might be envisaged to further knowledge organization in the forthcoming years. in addition to some proposals set forth at the end of this contribution, ten desiderata appear urgent. a preliminary condition to any other consideration is the recognition of the fundamental difference in the organization of knowledge between the concept (i.e., the unit of knowledge)-the conceptual level-and the word, term or code-the verbal level-and the need for implementing this distinction in theory and practice (desideratum 1). on this basis, some further proposals are enunciated. the 2 nd proposition concerns the surveying of extant classification systems, thesauri, and other means of organizing, ordering, and indexing knowledge; the 3 rd proposition envisages the improvement of expert training in knowledge organization (ko), also with regard to curricula and professional acknowledgment. nr.4) refers to the professionalization of the hitherto rather neglected national isko secretariats, as well as the international isko secretariat. nr.5) urges a systematic survey of ko-relevant concepts to serve as a model or standard for other subject fields, nr.6) claims the establishment of ko institutes, nr.7) views consultancy to the effect that anybody interested in ko may approach isko for help, nr 8) urges isko's promotion of membership and chapters in as many countries as possible, nr.9) presses for intensification of isko's publication activities, and nr.10) pleads for ko as a scientific discipline on its own.\n",

      "in recent years, the term “semantics” has been widely used in various fields of research and particularly in areas related to information technology. one of the motivators of such an appropriation is the vision of the semantic web, a set of developments underway, which might allow one to obtain better results when querying on the web. however, it is worth asking what kind of semantics we can find in the semantic web, considering that studying the subject is a complex and controversial endeavour. working within this context, we present an account of semantics relying on the main linguist approaches, in order to then analyze what semantics is within the scope of information technology. we critically evaluate a spectrum, which proposes the ordination of instruments (models, languages, taxonomic structures, to mention but a few) according to a semantic scale. in addition to proposing a new extended spectrum, the article suggests alternative interpretations with the aim of clarifying the use of the term “semantics” in different contexts. finally, we offer our conclusions regarding the semantic in the semantic web and mention future directions and complementary works.\n",
      "ontologies have an important role in knowledge organization and information retrieval. domain ontologies are composed of concepts represented by domain relevant terms. existing approaches of ontology construction make use of statistical and linguistic information to extract domain relevant terms. the quality and the quantity of this information influence the accuracy of terminologyextraction approaches and other steps in knowledge extraction and information retrieval. this paper proposes an approach forhandling domain relevant terms from arabic non-diacriticised semi-structured corpora. in input, the structure of documentsis exploited to organize knowledge in a contextual graph, which is exploitedto extract relevant terms. this network contains simple and compound nouns handled by a morphosyntactic shallow parser. the noun phrases are evaluated in terms of termhood and unithood by ; means of possibilistic measures. we apply a qualitative approach, which weighs terms according to their positions in the structure of the document. in output, the extracted knowledge is organized as network modeling dependencies between terms, which can be exploited to infer semantic relations.we test our approach on three specific domain corpora. the goal of this evaluation is to check if our model for organizing and exploiting contextual knowledge will improve the accuracy of extraction of simple and compound nouns. we also investigate the role of compound nouns in improving information retrieval results.\n",

      "any ontological theory commits us to accept and classify a number of phenomena in a more or less specific way – and vice versa: a classification tends to reveal the theoretical outlook of its creator. objects and their descriptions and relations are not just “given” but determined by theories. knowledge is fallible and consensus is rare. by implication, knowledge organization has to consider different theories/views and their foundations. bibliographical classifications depend on subject knowledge and on the same theories as corresponding scientific and scholarly classifications. some classifications are based on logical distinctions, others on empirical examinations, and some on mappings of common ancestors or on establishing functional criteria. to evaluate a classification is to involve oneself in the research which has produced the given classification. because research is always based more or less on specific epistemological ideals (e.g. empiricism, rationalism, historicism or pragmatism), the evaluation of classification includes the evaluation of the epistemological foundations of the research on which given classifications have been based. the field of knowledge organization itself is based on different approaches and traditions such as user-based and cognitive views, facet-analytical views, numeric taxonomic approaches, bibliometrics and domain-analytic approaches. these approaches and traditions are again connected to epistemological views, which have to be considered. only the domain-analytic view is fully committed to exploring knowledge organization in the light of subject knowledge and substantial scholarly theories.\n",

      "the purpose of this essay is to demonstrate that the mechanisms of power around classifications of gender and sexuality are not always top-down or bottom-up. instead, the weight of social discipline among members of sexual subcultures themselves helps to create these classifications, often reflecting the nomenclature of subjects and desires within sexual subcultures in a complex relationship to a dominant culture. critically examining two benchmarks in the development of sexual nomenclature within queer subcultures, this paper finds its evidence in george chauncey's little known analysis (1985) of a navy investigation of male homosexuality at the newport naval training station during the world war i era and in contemporary folksonomic classifi- cations of representations of queer desire within xtube, a database of online pornography. social discipline within these sexual sub- cultures occurs in the stabilization of nomenclature through socialization and through members' overt intervention into each oth- ers' self-understanding. both the newport and xtube evidence also reveals a complex social and cultural structure among members of sexual subcultures by drawing our attention to the particularity of various modes of sexual being and the relationship between those modes and particular configurations of sexual identity. in the process, this paper allows us to reassess, first, a presupposition of folksonomies as free of discipline allowing for their emancipatory potential and, second, the prevailing binary understandings of authority in the development of sexual nomenclatures and classifications as either top-down or bottom-up.\n",

      "in one of the most important conceptual changes of our times, biology has definitely abandoned its mechanistic hardcore and is advancing \"fast and furious\" along the informational dimension. biology has really become an information science; and, as such, it is also inspiring new ways of thinking and new kinds of knowledge paradigms beyond those discussed during past decades. in this regard, a new \"bioinformational\" approach to the inter-multi-disciplinary relationships among the sciences will be proposed herein: scientomics. biologically inspired, scientomics contemplates the multifarious interactions between scientific disciplines from the \"knowledge recombination\" vantage point. in their historical expansion, the sciences would have recapitulated upon collective cognitive dynamics already realized along the evolutionary expansion of living systems, mostly by means of domain recombination processes within cellular genomes, but also occurring neurally inside the \"cerebral workspace\" of human brains and advanced mammals. scientomics, understood as a new research field in the domain of knowledge organization, would capture the ongoing processes of scientific expansion and recombination by means of genomic inspired software (like in the new field of culturomics). it would explain the peculiar interaction maps of the sciences (scientometrics) as well as the increasing complexity of research amidst scientific and technological cumulative achievements. beyond the polarized classical positions of reductionism and holism, scientomics could also propose new conceptual tools for scientific integration and planning, and for research management.\n",

      "recent revision of udc classes has aimed at implementing a more faceted approach. many compound classes have been removed from the main tables, and more radical revisions of classes (particularly those for medicine and religion) have introduced a rigorous analysis, a clearer sense of citation order, and building of compound classes according to a more logical system syntax. the faceted approach provides a means of formalizing the relationships in the classification and making them explicit for machine recognition. in the bliss bibliographic classification (bc2) (which has been a source for both udc classes mentioned above), terminologies are encoded for automatic generation of hierarchical and associative relationships. nevertheless, difficulties are encountered in vocabulary control, and a similar phenomenon is observed in udc. current work has revealed differences in the vocabulary of humanities and science, notably the way in which terms in the humanities should be handled when these are semantically complex. achieving a balance between rigour in the structure of the classification and the complexity of natural language expression remains partially unresolved at present, but provides a fertile field for further research.\n",

      "we investigate whether existing knowledge organization systems (kos) for strong and hesitant forward-looking sentiment could be improved to detect social phenomena. five judges identified examples of strong/hesitant forward-looking sentiment that were used to compare the kos developed in the study to existing models. the 'composite' kos was subsequently applied to annual company reports to generate word frequency and biologically inspired diversity ratios. critical realism was used as a philosophy to interpret word patterns. results indicate the composite kos improved on existing models identified in the literature for strong forward-looking sentiment. in one company, a statistically significant association was found between increasing diversity of assertive forward-looking sentiment and subsequent declining relative business performance. this supported the pollyanna effect: the social phenomena of over-positive business language in that company. sharp increases in mentions of the 'future' and 'learnings' were discovered in another company which may be explained by an industrial disaster and subsequent crisis management rhetoric, supporting discourse of renewal theory. this study shows that improvements can be made to existing kos used to detect forward-looking sentiment in reports. adopting critical realism as a philosophy when analysing 'big data' may lead to improved theory generation and the potential for differentiating insights.\n",

      "modelling bibliographical entities is a prominent activity within knowledge organization today. current models of bibliographic entities, such as functional requirements for bibliographical records (frbr) and the bibliographic framework (bibframe), take inspiration from data-modelling methods developed by computer scientists from the mid-1970s on. thus, it would seem that the modelling of bibliographic entities is an activity of very recent vintage. however, it is possible to find examples of bibliographical models from earlier periods of knowledge organization. the purpose of this paper is to draw attention to one such model, outlined by the early 20th-century british classification theorist e. wyndham hulme in his essay on “principles of book classification” (1911–1912). there, hulme set forth a classification of various attributes by which books can conceivably be classified. these he first divided into accidental and inseparable attributes. accidental attributes were subdivided into edition-level and copy-level attributes and inseparable attitudes, into physical and non-physical attributes. comparison of hulme’s classification of attributes with those of frbr and bibframe 2.0 reveals that the different classes of attributes in hulme’s classification correspond to groups of attributes associated with different bibliographical entities in those models. these later models assume the existence of different bibliographic entities in an abstraction hierarchy among which attributes are distributed, whereas hulme posited only a single entity— the book—, whose various aspects he clustered into different classes of attributes. thus, hulme’s model offers an interesting alternative to current assumptions about how to conceptualize the relationship between attributes and entities in the bibliographical universe.\n",

      "research suggests organizations across all sectors waste a significant amount of time looking for information and often fail to leverage the information they have. in response, many organizations have deployed some form of enterprise search to improve the ˜findability of information. debates persist as to whether thesauri and manual indexing or automated machine learning techniques should be used to enhance discovery of information. in addition, the extent to which a knowledge organization system (kos) enhances discoveries or indeed blinds us to new ones remains a moot point. the oil and gas industry is used as a case study using a representative organization. drawing on prior research, a theoretical model is presented which aims to overcome the shortcomings of each approach. this synergistic model could help re-conceptualize the ˜manual versus ˜automatic debate in many enterprises, accommodating a broader range of information needs. this may enable enterprises to develop more effective information and knowledge management strategies and ease the tension between what is often perceived as mutually exclusive competing approaches. certain aspects of the theoretical model may be transferable to other industries which is an area for further research. the article was selected as a best paper from the international society of knowledge organization (isko) conference where the paper is also online at: http://www.iskouk.org/content/best-both-worlds-highlighting-synergies-combining-knowledge-modelling-and-automated\n",

      "this article considers a particularly knotty aspect of classifying notated music: the classification of instrumental ensembles, where the term ensemblesis defined as music written for multiple players with only one player per part. facet analysis is used to examine this area of music classification and as the basis of a model for classifying ensembles. the conceptual analysis is aided by examples drawn from two classification schemes, british catalogue of music classification (bcmc) and flexible classification. first, this exploration reveals that there are conceptually four sub-facets for classifying instrument ensembles, and that the omission of any of these sub-facets causes issues within classification schemes. next, the different type of relationships between pairs of these sub-facets is delineated, including hierarchical and associative relationships. the classification of ensembles is depicted in a novel way, as a series of inter-connected relationships between sub-facets. finally, the article ascertains exactly what is being counted, including introducing potential extra sets of sub-facets pertaining to performers and hands. so, facet analysis helps to create a model for classifying instrumental ensembles which provides a novel solution to this historically problematic area of music classification, as well as suggesting a potentially generalizable new way of thinking about complex relationships between sub-facets\n",

      "automated subject classification has been a challenging research issue for many years now, receiving particular attention in the past decade due to rapid increase of digital documents. the most frequent approach to automated classification is machine learning. it, however, requires training documents and performs well on new documents only if these are similar enough to the former. we explore a string-matching algorithm based on a controlled vocabulary, which does not require training documents--instead it reuses the intellectual work put into creating the controlled vocabulary. terms from the engineering information thesaurus and classification scheme were matched against title and abstract of engineering papers from the compendex database. simple string-matching was enhanced by several methods such as term weighting schemes and cut-offs, exclusion of certain terms, and enrichment of the controlled vocabulary with automatically extracted terms. the best results are 76% recall when the controlled vocabulary is enriched with new terms, and 79% precision when certain terms are excluded. precision of individual classes is up to 98%. these results are comparable to state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms.\n",

      "narcis—national academic research and collaborations information system-- is the national research portal for the netherlands’ data and research archiving, which is governed by its own narcis classification. the current instantiation of the classification dates from 2015. the classification is currently made up of two classes—d for the sciences broadly, and e for interdisciplinary areas. the narcis classification is designed specifically and with care for the contents of the narcis data portal. the classification mostly represents the sciences. a few anomalous situations are visible in the ontology of the classification: the humanities occupy one division within the sciences, placed between the life sciences and law; and, the treatment of interdisciplinarity, for which a separate class e is set aside for interdisciplinary sciences. a dump of the narcis database was used to analyze the population of the narcis classification. the life sciences occupy 34% of the narcis database. a framework for research networking systems reveals the narcis database and its classification most objectives, with the only lapse being the output of entities and attributes to ontologies. the narcis classification is also an occupational classification. the narcis classification supports a vital research portal that, in turn, supports a nationally-coordinated research effort designed to provide better inter-institutional communication of scholarly productivity, thus is in itself an information institution, in which domain-dependence is part of its cultural imperative. the narcis classification incorporates an example of top-down politics in which funded disciplines are included and best represented. a perhaps unintended consequence is the encapsulation of forced views. trajectories for further discussion with regard to continued development of the narcis classification include identity, interoperability, interdisciplinarity, and synthesis.\n",

      "<p>mining product reviews and sentiment analysis are of great significance, whether for academic research purposes or optimizing business strategies. we propose a feature-level sentiment analysis framework based on rules parsing and fine-grained domain ontology for chinese reviews. fine-grained ontology is used to describe synonymous expressions of product features, which are reflected in word changes in online reviews. first, a semiautomatic construction method is developed by using word2vec for fine-grained ontology. then, feature-level sentiment analysis that combines rules parsing and the fine-grained domain ontology is conducted to extract explicit and implicit features from product reviews. finally, the domain sentiment dictionary and context sentiment dictionary are established to identify sentiment polarities for the extracted feature-sentiment combinations. an experiment is conducted on the basis of product reviews crawled from chinese e-commerce websites. the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. </p>\n",

      "research information can be useful to science stakeholders for discovering, evaluating and planning research activities. in the netherlands, the institute tasked with the stewardship of national research information is dans (data archiving and networked services). dans is the home of narcis, the national portal for research information, which uses a similarly named national research classification. the narcis classification assigns symbols to represent the knowledge-bases of contributing scholars. a recent research stream in knowledge organization known as comparative classification uses two or more classifications experimentally to generate empirical evidence about coverage of conceptual content, population of the classes, and economy of classification. this paper builds on that research in order to further understand the comparative impact of the narcis classification alongside a classification designed specifically for information resources. our six cases come from the dans project knowledge organi- zation system observatory (koso), which itself is classified using the information coding classification (icc) created in 1982 by ingetraut dahlberg. icc is considered to have the merits of universality, faceting, and a top-down approach. results are exploratory, indicating that both classifications provide fairly precise coverage. the inflexibility of the narcis classification makes it difficult to express complex concepts. the meta-ontological, epistemic stance of the icc is apparent in all aspects of this study. using the two together in the dans kos observatory will provide users with both clarity of scientific positioning and ontological relativity.\n",

      "<p>the principle of provenance is one of the most important milestones in archival practice and theory from the time its establishment grounded the scientific dimension of archival discipline in the nineteenth century. since then, provenance and document context have supported the organization of archival knowledge (especially through classification and description procedures). such relationships were gradually refined over the years and from different experiences between european archives and their classification and ordering systems. historically, the principle of provenance is a pivotal moment in the development of archival theory, crucial to understanding the nature of records and archives. however, in archival theory, the principle of provenance still does not correspond to a single term or a single definition and scarce normalization terminology remains one of the problems of archival science, which leads to a lack of consensus about the division between the two principles of provenance and original order. recently, the concept of provenance has been addressed by many other disciplines (law, library and information science, computer science and visual analytics) and applied to different domains (cloud-based storage, preservation of digital records, digital evidence, digital humanities, e-science, open data, linked data, knowledge organization and indexing. as the use of provenance reaches new domains it is no longer just an organizing principle but also a means of reaching for authenticity and reliability of data and objects in digital environments or museums or to reestablish the original organic relationship in library collections. </p>\n",

      "<p>the basics concept classification (bcc) is a “universal” scheme: it attempts to encompass all areas of human understanding. whereas most universal schemes are organized around scholarly disciplines, the bcc is instead organized around phenomena (things), the relationships that exist among phenomena, and the properties that phenomena and relators may possess. this structure allows the bcc to apply facet analysis without requiring the use of “facet indicators.” the main motivation for the bcc was a recognition that existing classifications that are organized around disciplines serve interdisciplinary scholarship poorly. complex concepts that might be understood quite differently across groups and individuals can generally be broken into basic concepts for which there is enough shared understanding for the purposes of classification. documents, ideas, and objects are classified synthetically by combining entries from the schedules of phenomena, relators, and properties. the inclusion of separate schedules of-generally verb-like-relators is one of the most unusual aspects of the bcc. this (and the schedules of properties that serve as adjectives or adverbs) allows the production of sentence-like subject strings. documents can then be classified in terms of the main arguments made in the document. bcc provides very precise descriptors of documents by combining phenomena, relators, and properties synthetically. the terminology employed in the bcc reduces terminological ambiguity. the bcc is still being developed and it needs to be fleshed out in certain respects. yet it also needs to be applied; only in application can the feasibility and desirability of the classification be adequately assessed. </p>\n",
