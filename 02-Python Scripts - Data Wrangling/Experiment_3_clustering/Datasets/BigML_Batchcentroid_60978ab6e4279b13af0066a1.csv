The paper attempts to provoke thought about new frontiers of visual knowledge organization. Computers introduce the possibility of interchangeable media. They offer multiple nodes of access to a given term or object. They enable us to approach knowledge on different levels. A scheme of 10 levels is proposed and some consequences for visual knowledge at each of these levels is considered briefly. The final section of the paper considers four navigational tools: questions, maps, meters, and tracking",Cluster 1

As a secondary topic the scientific relations existing among Information Science, Epistemology, and the Cognitive Sciences are discussed. Classification is seen as a central activity in all daily and scientific activities, and, of course, of knowledge organization in information services. There is a mutual implication between classification and conceptualization, as the former moves in a natural way to the latter and the best result elaborated for classification is the concept. Research in concept theory is a need for a Theory of Classification. In this direction it is of outstanding importance to integrate the achievements of natural concept formation theory (NCFT) as an alternative approach to conceptualization different from the traditional one of logicians and problem solving researchers. In clonclusion both approaches are seen as being complementary: the NCFP approach being closer to the user and the logical one being more suitable for experts, including expert systems",Cluster 6

This lack of systematic documentation severely handicaps all historical research that involves the interpretation of iconographic detail. It leaves us unable to count the frequency with which subjects have been represented, or with which iconographic particularities occur. This article asks whether the use of the iconographic classification system ICONCLASS will help to create countable iconographic information. Its first part deals with the considerations that have guided the shape of the computer edition that has recently been made available. These may be relevant for the electronic publication of classification systems in general.

In addition to the important distinctions between the fundamental concepts and terms (tags) used in Onomantics and Terminology, as reported in the first two parts of this essay, several other interesting comparisons can be made. First, with reference to formats, both the structure and nomenclature used for terminological entries (records) in ISO 1087 parallel those found in dictionaries and suggest a semantic rather than an onomantic point of view. Second, a large number of borrowed terms taken from Lexicography and Linguistics can be found in this glossary for the terminology of Terminology. Sometimes the definitions for these terms identify them as borrowed concepts drawn from the vocabulary used by lexicographers. However, sometimes new meanings are stipulated for these terms without any markings to show that they are not borrowed concepts. Moreover, in all these cases, since the original and the newly stipulated concepts are similar, ambiguity is unavoidable. Third, some concepts that might be useful for terminologists are not included in ISO 1087: a few examples are explained. They are all concepts which lexicographers do not need and, consequently, they have no terms for them. It seems apparent that they have been omitted from the vocabulary of Terminology simply because they are new concepts without established terms. To explain the reasons for the formats, terms and omissions found in the leading glossary for the terminology of Terminology takes us into a realm of speculation that is too complicated for inclusion here, but I will discuss it in Part IV of this series, with a focus on the problems of neologisms",Cluster 5
006-948-163-366-774,"This paper is put up for discussion to help Knowledge Organization find its proper place. To begin with, a few basic concepts from the field of communication theory are defined. The new concepts permit the conclusion that what we are facing at present is not a flood of information but one of messages, and that this latter flood must not be equated indiscriminately with a knowledge flood. Messages must be judged on their contents. To this end, «knowledge» is subdivided into «core-», «peripheral», and «pseudo-knowledge», and it is argued that the great majority of scientific publications contains peripheral and pseudoknowledge. With the aid of two interlocking and self-amplying recursive mechanisms it is shown that and how pseudoknowledge is more and more gaining disciplines, hence precisely in those fields which deal with social problems in the broadest sense of the world; Thus a deficit of knowledge on which to base action is produced, leading to a general disorientation - a modern form of ignorance, keenly manifesting it self at present in a crisis of leadership.

The linkage deals with establishing the proper correspondences between components of the base and the representing part. Each of these knowledge kinds is associated with specific structures related to concepts (symbols, names, statements, images, texts, entities and their properties and relations, procedures of determination of property values, etc.).

This applicability has repeatedly been viewed as being just a miracle. One major idea to diminsh the miraculous impression was to view mathematics as exploring the vast area ofall kinds ofabstract structures, thus establishing a huge store of humanly possible thinking from which the physicist has only to choose the structure appropriate for the case before him.

To this end, seven elementary representation principles are proposed. To illustrate the way they work, syntactic pattern recognition is introduced as a simple, but non-trivial example for representing knowledge in formal language. Another central thema of the paper is LEIBNIZ's characteristica universalis and the so-called LEIBNIZ project. LEIBNIZ's investigations in this field are reviewed against the background of the tasks required in syntactic pattern recognition. It is demonstrated that LEIBNIZ had, in fact, already worked with six ofthe seven representation principles proposed, further, that his characteristica universalis is an early form of a formal language, and lastly, that - contrary to the prevailing view - the LEIBNIZ project is not a matter of logic but rather one of knowledge representation, a field largely unexploited in today's logic-oriented epistemology and philosophy of science. It is precisely this one-sided orientation of these disciplines, which is responsible for the distorted picture of LEIBNIZ's work found in the literature; some typical misunderstandings are finally discussed.

It progresses by association, affinity and juxtaposition of two divergent ideas in an integrative approach. To argue a case, a legal expert cannot limit himself to the perception of isolated facts, but instead must find affinities between fields expressing more cohesion in law. In this paper, it is argued that the legal specialist relies on abstract categorization to discover a precedent and thereby create a metaphorical link that serves in the argumentation stage, and also later on in the resolution of the case. On this basis, a model of case reasoning is charted that integrates a model of analogical reasoning. In the same manner, a model of analogical reasoning is designed that combines quality induction and deduction. Furthermore, it is advocated that a rich representation of a law category is required to make a good induction. Similarly, it is specified that quality induction should be constrained by abstract rules in order to preserve legal principles and compute profound similarity between cases to discover the precedent.

092-264-638-820-590,"Traditionally, database indexing and book indexing have been looked upon as being quite distinct and have been kept apart in textbooks and teaching. The traditional borderline between both variations of indexing, however, should not conceal fundamental commonalities of the two approaches. For example, thesaurus construction and usage, quite common in databases, has hardly been encountered in book indexing so far. Database indexing, on the other hand, has hardly made use of subheadings of the syntax-displaying type, quite common in book indexing. Most database users also prefer precombining vocabulary units and reject concept analysis. However, insisting on precombining descriptors in a large database vocabulary may, in the long run, well be destructive to the quality of indexing and of the searches. A complementary approach is conceivable which provides both precombinations and analyzed subjects, both index language syntax and subheadings, and provides access to an information system via precombinations, without jeopardizing the manageability of the vocabulary. Such an approach causes considerable costs in input because it involves a great deal of intellectual work. On the other hand, much time and costs will be saved in the use of the system. In addition, such an approach would endow an information system with survival power.",Cluster 6

Symbol manipulation systems had been considered by Leibniz as a methodology of inferring knowledge in a secure and purely mechanical fashion. Such inference calculi were considered as mere artefacts which could not possibly encompass all human knowledge acquisition. In Alan Turing's work one notices a crucial shift of perspective. The abstract mathematical states of a Turing machine (a kind of calculus universalis that Leibniz was looking for) are claimed to correspond to equivalent psychological states. Artefacts are turned into faithful models of human cognition. A further step toward the Computational Theory of Mind was the physical symbol system hypothesis, contending to have found a necessary and sufficient criterion for the presence of intelligence in operative mediums. This, together with Chomsky's foundational work on linguistics, led naturally to the Computational Theory of Mind as set out by Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn. We discuss problematic aspects of this theory. Then we deal with another paradigm of the Computational Theory of Mind based on network automata. This sub-symbolic paradigm seems to avoid problems occuring in symbolic computations, like the proble frame problem and graceful degradation",Cluster 1

Any requirement to obtain commercial support at this pre-development stage prevents the emergence of even farsighted latent support that could hurdle the remaining steps.

This structural principle is no longer adequate because multidisciplinary knowledge production has overtaken more traditional disciplinary perspectives and produced communities of cooperation whose documents cannot be accommodated in a disciplinary structure. This paper addresses the problems the major classifications face, reports some attempts to revise these systems to accommodate multidisciplinary works more appropriately, and describes some theoretical research perspectives that attempt to reorient classification research toward the pluralistic needs of multidisciplinary knowledge creation and the perspectives of different discourse communities. Traditionally, the primary desiderata of classification systems were mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity. The need to respond to multidisciplinary research may mean that hospitality will replace mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity as the most needed and useful characteristics of classification systems in both theory and practice.",Cluster 2

Part IV, finally, offers a speculative explanation of these problems. My central hypothesis is that an aversion to neologisms - especially newly coined words - impedes the introduction and acceptance of new concepts. The pressure for standardization of terminology compounds this difficulty. There are three kinds of neologisms: 1. newly coined words (neoterisms), 2. phases composed of familiar words (phrasal tags) and 3. familiar words for which new meanings have been stipulated (meta-terms). Neologisms in the form of phrases containing familiar words are often found in ISO 1087. Some perplexing ambiguities in ISO 1087 occur when new meanings are stipulated for familiar words, creating terminological metaphors (meta-terms) that are often obscure. Such meta-terms abound in the terminology of Terminology. Increased willingness to accept well-formed new words (neoterisms) would greatly simplify the development of a more adequate terminology for Terminology. The use of pleonasms is recommended as a technique to overcome ambiguity by linking familiar words having new meanings (meta-terms) to new words for the same concepts (neoterisms) and as a simple way to facilitate the introduction of such neoterisms.",Cluster 3

Starting from the ,,implications of word-contents, she attempts to construct a complete grammar of the German language.

In the second part of his comments, the reviewer then takes up his own semiotic language theory published in 1981, showing that semantics is but one of four semiotic dimensions of language, the other dimensions being the sigmatic, the pragmatic and the syntactic. Without taking all four dimensions into account, no theory can offer an adequate integrative language model. Indeed, without all four dimensions, one cannot even develop an adequate grammar of German sentence construction. The fourfold semiotic model discloses as well the universally valid structures of language as the intersubjective expression of human self-awareness.

194-556-078-156-224,"Different approaches to the classification of a knowledge field include empiristic, rationalistic, historicist, and pragmatic methods. This paper demonstrates how these different methods have been applied to the classification of psychology. An etymological approach is insufficient to define the subject matter of psychology, because other terms can be used to describe the same domain. To define the subject matter of psychology from the point of view of its formal establishment as a science and academic discipline (in Leipzig, 1879) is also insufficient because this was done in specific historical circumstances, which narrowed the subject matter to physiologically-related issues. When defining the subject area of a scientific field it is necessary to consider how different ontological and epistemological views have made their influences. A subject area and the approaches by which this subject area has been studied cannot be separated from each other without tracing their mutual historical interactions. The classification of a subject field is theory-laden and thus cannot be neutral or ahistorical. If classification research can claim to have a method that is more general than the study of the concrete developments in the single knowledge fields the key is to be found in the general epistemological theories. It is shown how basic epistemological assumptions have formed the different approaches to psychology during the 20th century. The progress in the understanding of basic philosophical questions is decisive both for the development of a knowledge field and as the point of departure of classification.

Indeed, it seemed obvious to us that the reasoning at the root of any activity is based on words used to describe it. This terminology inventory which we called Structured Terminology Environment (STE), together with the modelling diagram, could eventually be directly used during the conceiving of a software tool specific to the studied professional activity. The STE is a thesaurus of 565 words selected on the basis of a corpus stemming from five pharmacy theses and six books, where we put the significant terms which represent the actors and actions we observed during the ten phases, as well as the handled tools. Once the terms were shared out among the ten basic operations, we structured the terminology by grouping the concepts of a same nature so that the sub-categories show a certain homogeneity around the action. We used the following basic relationships: generic/specific relationships, whole/part relationships and finally, we completed the categorization with the help of classes induced by facets (process, phenomenon, properties, material or object, tool or equipment and operating conditions).",Cluster 5

014-482-297-957-834,"Organizing and providing access to the resources on the Internet has been a problem area in spite of the availability of sophisticated search engines and other software tools. There have been several attempts to organize the resources on the World Wide Web. Some of them have tried to use traditional library classification schemes such as the Library of Congress Classification, the Dewey Decimal Classification and others. However there is a need to assign proper subject headings to them and present them in a logical or hierarchical sequence to cater to the need for browsing. This paper attempts to describe an experimental system designed to organize and provide access to web documents using a faceted pre-coordinate indexing system based on the Deep Structure Indexing System (DSIS) derived from POPSI (Postulate based Permuted Subject Indexing) of Bhattacharyya, and the facet analysis and chain indexing system of Ranganathan. A prototype software system has been designed to create a database of records specifying Web documents according to the Dublin Core and to input a faceted subject heading according to DSIS. Synonymous terms are added to the standard terms in the heading using appropriate symbols. Once the data are entered along with a description and the URL of the web document, the record is stored in the system. More than one faceted subject heading can be assigned to a record depending on the content of the original document. The system stores the surrogates and keeps the faceted subject headings separately after establishing a link. The search is carried out on index entries derived from the faceted subject heading using the chain indexing technique. If a single term is input, the system searches for its presence in the faceted subject headings and displays the subject headings in a sorted sequence reflecting an organizing sequence. If the number of retrieved headings is too large (running into more than a page) the user has the option of entering another search term to be searched in combination. The system searches subject headings already retrieved and looks for those containing the second term. The retrieved faceted subject headings can be displayed and browsed. When the relevant subject heading is selected the system displays the records with their URLs. Using the URL, the original document on the web can be accessed.

In information retrieval, the primary purpose of classification is to find knowledge that already exists, but one of the purposes of classification in other fields is to discover new knowledge. In this paper, classifications for information retrieval are called professional classifications because they are devised by people who have a professional interest in classification, and classifications for knowledge discovery are called naive classifications because they are devised by people who have no particular interest in studying classification as an end in itself. This paper compares the overall purposes and methods of these two kinds of classifications and provides a general model of the relationships between the two kinds of classificatory activity in the context of information studies.

The concept of genre is examined in relation to epistemology and to different values and views in both musicology and libraries. The point of departure is to regard music as a domain of actors, institutions and processes. A comprehensive definition of this domain is suggested, which includes several subdomains and discourses. The classical music subdomain and the popular music subdomain are introduced and related to libraries. The article further investigates the concept of paradigm in relation to musicology. It demonstrates how two different paradigms influence the way music is defined, described, classified and indexed and how they are part of a historical context. The fourth part of the article focuses on the concept of genre and the analysis of music and the relation between analytical methods and values/paradigms. In addition, this part focuses on the actors that are responsible for the verbalization of genres in music. The fifth part examines indexing of musical genres with a view to their function as subject access points in databases. The unsatisfactory state of today's practice, as well as the need of a better theoretical foundation of the concept of genre, is documented. The unsatisfactory differentiation in the organising of popular music is exemplified by Danish and Norwegian libraries, including the DK5 system and the Indeksering afmusik guidelines. Finally, arguments are put forward for developing an anthropological paradigm in relation to organizing music in libraries.",Cluster 4

The perspective will help to reveal the condition of possibilities of knowledge organization and its strong connection with communication technologies, and their constitution of the social organization of society. The means and modes of communication fundamentally alter existing ways of thinking and of producing, communicating and organizing knowledge. The LIS concept of knowledge organization will be analyzed in relation to the storing and communication of knowledge in oral cultures, written cultures, print culture, and electronic cultures. Through this, it will be argued that the narrow LIS concept of knowledge organization is subordinated and in interaction with a broader social organization of knowledge in society. Further, it will be argued that the rise of the Internet as a source of knowledge and information must be understood in relation to and in continuation of this interaction.

The analysis indicates that different socially and historically embedded discourses on art, including pre-paradigmatic studies and scholarly paradigms, pervade knowledge organization in the art institution at three levels, respectively: 1. Art exhibitions, 2. Primary and tertiary document types (printed, audio-visual, and multimedia documents), and 3. Classification systems, bibliographies, and thesauri.

The paper also addresses the relationship among paradigms, principles for exhibiting works of art, ways of conceptualising and organizing the content in documents on art history, and LIS knowledge organization systems. It is concluded that the UDC, in particular, is well suited for representation of knowledge produced in the contexts of pre-paradigmatic, iconological, and stylistic studies. But documents by the so-called New art scholars drawing on interdisciplinary studies and representing new approaches and paradigms break with the taxonomies on art in the classical hierarchical, universal classification systems.

The study followed a qualitative four-phase research methodology. The first phase was a phenomenological analysis of the basic characteristics of social work as a social service. The analysis resulted in a seven-facet subject classification. In the second phase the conceptual skeleton was elaborated, and adjusted to the field of social work by a grounded-theory methodology. The data used for grounding the model were 14 social work resources. The model was tested in the third phase by classifying 200 terms randomly selected from the Dictionary of Social Work (Barker, 1999).

The history and origin of bibliographic classification [Dewey, Bliss, Mills, Beghtol] are discussed from the perspective of pragmatist philosophy and social studies of science [Kuhn, Merton, Reica]. Choices of structural principles in different schemes are found to rely on more or less implicit philosophical foundations, ranging from rationalism to pragmatism. It is further shown how the increasing application of faceted structures as basic structural principles in universal classification schemes [DDC, UDC] impose rationalistic principles and structures for knowledge organization which are not in alignment with the development of knowledge in the covered disciplines. Further evidence of rationalism in knowledge organization is the fiction/non-fiction distinction, excluding the important role of artistic resources for, in particular, humanistic research. Finally, for the analysis of appropriate bibliographic unit, it is argued that there is a need to shift towards a semiotic approach, founded on an understanding of intertextuality, rather than applying standard principles of hierarchical decomposition of documents. It is concluded that a change in classification research is needed, founded on a more historical and social understanding of knowledge.",Cluster 2

Literary criticism, in particular, frequently addresses the question: when is a work about homosexuality? This paper explores this literary debate and its implications for the design of subject access systems for gay and lesbian communities. By examining the literary criticism of Herman Melville's Billy Budd, particularly in relation to the theories of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick in The Epistemology of the Closet (1990), this paper exposes three tensions that designers of gay and lesbian classifications and vocabularies can expect to face. First is a tension between essentialist and constructivist views of homosexuality, which will affect the choice of terms, categories, and references. Second is a tension between minoritizing and universalizing perspectives on homosexuality. Third is a redefined distinction between aboutness and meaning, in which aboutness refers not to stable document content, but to the system designer's inescapable social and ideological perspectives.

Diametrically different opinions, seemingly corroborated through empirical evidence, have been presented since the time of the Cranfield experiments. Similar situations have often been encountered in the history of science if reasoning has exclusively been based on empiricism. In the information scientific field, several empirical laws have been formulated, for example that of the alledgedly inverse precision-recall relationship in information retrieval, of the assumed direct relationship between consistency and quality of indexing, and of the alledged equivalence of automatic with intellectual indexing. Empiricism is seen as only another variation of positivism, which has been abandoned in the natural sciences since the middle of this century for its evident inadequacy, but has latently survived in information science and even now dominates here. Here, it constitutes a source of continual confusion and an impediment to progress.

In particular, the elaborate terminology generated by S.R. Ranganathan is examined. Definitions are provided for numerous concepts, including classification; characteristics and attributes; the genus-species relationship; the types of classes (canonical, systems, special, and environmental main classes); the kinds of subject (basic, compound, complex); as well as concepts such as facets, isolates, arrays, and chains.

Works are those deliberate creations (known variously as opera, oeuvres, Werke, etc.) that constitute individual sets of created conceptions that stand as the formal records of knowledge. In the information retrieval domain, the work as opposed to the document, has only recently received focused attention. In this paper, the definition of the work as an entity for information retrieval is examined. A taxonomic definition (that is, a definition built around a taxonomy) is presented. An epistemological perspective aids in understanding the components of the taxonomic definition. Works, thus defined as entities for information retrieval, are seen to constitute sets of varying instantiations of abstract creations. These variant instantiations must be explicitly identified in future systems for documentary information retrieval. An expanded perception of works, such as that presented in this paper, helps us understand the variety of ways in which mechanisms for their control and retrieval might better be shaped in future.",Cluster 3

The Genre and Activity of the Experimental Article in Science is written knowledge as it is produced by the academy. Bazerman discusses in particular the rhetoric, communicative, and epistemological issues of written knowledge. The article discusses these themes in a library and information science (LIS) perspective in terms of their implications for LIS research. For several reasons, it is argued that this way of scrutinizing into written knowledge ought to be of special interest to LIS research. As an example of a particular field of research in LIS, the article discusses the relationship between indexing theory and written knowledge. Bazerman analyzes written knowledge from a literary point of view. Among other things, it is argued that indexing theory can be seen as part of literary theory in that some of the questions raised by the latter are also raised in indexing theory. Furthermore, it is put forward that the indexer can be considered an author. The indexer produces a text, the document representation, which is the text the user actually meets in the first place. That way, the producer of a document representation is to some extent responsible for the quality of the documents indexed. Having discussed this relationship between written knowledge and LIS research in general and indexing theory in particular, it is concluded that LIS research ought to head toward more humanistic oriented research traditions, if the line of research presented by Bazerman should be considered useful for LIS.",Cluster 3

132-693-568-339-041,"Natural text phrasing is an indeterminate process and, thus, inherently lacks representational predictability. This holds true in particular in the case of general concepts and of their syntactical connectivity. Hence, natural language query phrasing and searching is an unending adventure of trial and error and, in most cases, has an unsatisfactory outcome with respect to the recall and precision ratios of the responses. Human indexing is based on knowledgeable document interpretation and aims - among other things - at introducing predictability into the representation of documents. Due to the indeterminacy of natural language text phrasing and image construction, any adequate indexing is also indeterminate in nature and therefore inherently defies any satisfactory algorithmization. But human indexing suffers from a different set of deficiencies which are absent in the processing of non-interpreted natural language. An optimally effective information system combines both types of language in such a manner that their specific strengths are preserved and their weaknesses are avoided. If the goal is a large and enduring information system for more than merely known-item searches, the expenditure for an advanced index language and its knowledgeable and careful employment is unavoidable.",Cluster 3

182-499-359-463-219,"The physical organisation of items on library shelves using any classification scheme is inevitably a compromise. The best efforts to achieve an arrangement char is helpful to users will be thwarted by the multifaceted nature of these items and the specific needs of the user and the library. Items on a particular subject will be scattered throughout the library building(s) across disciplines, by physical form, by frequency of use and whether and for how long they may be borrowed. Even though the rich information content of multifaceted items may be represented in the notation, the items required by a user will be scattered across library shelves when the item is placed in a single relative location. This paper explores these issues using examples from a University Library classified using the Dea ey Decimal Classification Scheme (DDC). The electronic context of the library OPAC can transcend the constraints imposed by the predominantly physical nature of library collections, yet the current use of classification schemes in on-line systems retains many of these limitations. Examples of such systems applying DDC on the World Wide Web are discussed and compared with a system that seeks to use DDC in what is called view-based searching. The interface and the resulting browsing and searching capability of a View-Based Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) are described. Ways in which subject. access to library collections can be improved and disciplinary scatter resolved by assigning multiple class numbers to items and exploiting the rich Dewey structure in a faceted form are discussed. It is suggested that the informative power of visual classificatory structures at the search interface will be beneficial to the broader learning experience of the user. The paper concludes that the application of classification schemes in electronic interfaces should not be bound by the physical constraints that no longer apply in an electronic context but be exploited to provide a complete, flexible and individual interface as determined by the needs of each user.",Cluster 4

We launch collaborative task situations as a new unit of analysis for capturing evolving semantic structures in work domains. An example case from a cognitive work analysis of three national film research archives illustrates the application of the framework for identifying actors' needs for a classification scheme to support collaborative knowledge integration.

One of the major contributions in this area of personalization of the system's response is by taking into consideration each user's specificity. We propose the use of explicit user model where the system's solution will be determined by the knowledge of the user. The user's activities are recorded as documents.

The majority of methods proposing evaluation metrics (bibliometrics and scientometrics studies) for STW rely solely on statistical data analysis methods (co-citation analysis, co-word analysis). Such methods usually work on structured databases where the units of analysis (words, keywords) are already attributed to documents by human indexers. The advent of huge amounts of unstructured textual data has rendered necessary the integration of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to first extract meaningful units from texts. We propose a method for STW which is NLP-oriented. The method not only analyses texts linguistically in order to extract terms from them, but also uses linguistic relations (syntactic variations) as the basis for clustering. Terms and variation relations are formalised as weighted di-graphs which the clustering algorithm, CPCL (Classification by Preferential Clustered Link) will seek to reduce in order to produce classes. These classes ideally represent the research topics present in the corpus. The results of the classification are subjected to validation by an expert in STW.",Cluster 2
194-391-518-246-985,"This article is organized in 10 sections: (1) Knowledge Organization (KO) is a wide interdisciplinary field, much broader than Library and Information Science (LIS). (2) Inside LIS there have been many different approaches and traditions of KO with little mutual influence. These traditions have to a large extent been defined by new technology, for which reason the theoretical integration and underpinning has not been well considered. The most important technology-driven traditions are: a) Manual indexing and classification in libraries and reference works, b) Documentation and scientific communication, c) Information storage and retrieval by computers, d) Citation based KO and e) Full text, hypertext and Internet based approaches. These traditions taken together define very much the special LIS focus on KO. For KO as a field of research it is important to establish a fruitful theoretical frame of reference for this overall field. This paper provides some suggestions. (3) One important, theoretical distinction to consider is the one between social and intellectual forms of KO. Social forms of KO are related to professional training, disciplines and social groups while intellectual organization is related to concepts and theories in the fields to be organized. (4) The social perspective includes in addition the systems of genres and documents as well as the social system of knowledge producers, knowledge intermediaries and knowledge users. (5) This social system of documents, genres and agents makes available a very complicated structure of potential subject access points (SAPs), which may be used in information retrieval (IR). The basic aim of research in KO is to develop knowledge on how to optimise this system of SAPs and its utilization in IR. (6) SAPs may be seen as signs, and their production and use may be understood from a social semiotic point of view. (7) The concept of paradigms is also helpful because different groups and interests tend to be organized according to a paradigm and to develop different criteria of relevance, and thus different criteria of likeliness in KO. (8) The basic unit in KO is the semantic relation between two concepts, and such relations are embedded in theories. (9) In classification like things are grouped together, but what is considered similar is not a trivial question. (10) The paper concludes with the considering of methods for KO. Basically the methods of any field are connected with epistemological theories. This is also the case with KO. The existing methods as described in the literature of KO fit into a classification of basic epistemological views. The debate about the methods of KO at the deepest level therefore implies an epistemological discussion.",Cluster 2

The keywords collected were then analyzed quantitatively statistically by uncovering their frequency and percentage distribution and through a statistical correspondence analysis in order to uncover possible patterns in the users' tags. Subsequently, a qualitative textual analysis of the tags was made in order to find out by analysis which tagging strategies are represented in the data material. This led to four conclusions. 1) the distribution of keywords follows classic power law; 2) distinct tagging communities are identifiable; 3) the most frequently used tags are situated on a general-specific axis; and 4) nine distinct tagging strategies are observed.

The authors analyze three weblogs (Biblioatipici, Letture and Andrea Marchitelli’s blog) to demonstrate that different contents may be classified using the appropriate scheme.; Biblioatipici is a weblog about temporary workers in libraries and Italian documentation centres, indexed with a faceted scheme, home made by authors. Letture, a diary about reading and books, is indexed by DDC; finally, Andrea Marchitelli’s blog, a weblog about digital libraries and open access, is indexed by JITA, the scheme used for indexing e-prints in some different open archives.; The three applications are presented starting from the most complex scheme (i.e. the faceted one) to the simple but least functional (JITA), passing through a traditional bibliographic classification scheme, the Dewey Decimal Classification.; The analysis demonstrates that different web contents can efficiently be classified with different schemes. In particular, with the facets one (Biblioatipici) the indexer is able to generate the needed classes in the indexing phase. Moreover with a small number of facets and foci one can obtain an exponential number of classes. Finally, one of the advantages for the user is that the faceted scheme allows multiple accesses on the basis of different information requirements, in addition to being coherent and intuitive. DDC scheme can be more suitable than the first web pages or blogs performing a sort of digital library. In this case in fact the DDC scheme constitutes a consolidated classification standard, widespread in a huge quantity of libraries and the use of a different scheme might get confusion. JITA scheme, finally, can find a huge applicability in web pages (or blogs) in LIS field showing several advantages: it’s very simple and essentialy pragmatic, intuitive and coherent.

The following question is considered: Could Repertory Grid technique be used as a tool in the creation of metadata? It is postulated that repertory grid technique may be used as a tool for creating metadata labels, or tags, where the labels or tags describe entities, which may be images, documents or expressions. Repertory grid technique can provide a method for examining the detail about an individual's mental models, or personal construct systems of lifeworld entities, which may include images, documents or expressions. The question were considered by looking at the results of an earlier study, which explored the personal constructs of systems analysts using the repertory grid technique to examine the mental conceptualizations that determine the extent of difference in conceptualization. Categorical core areas of expressions used during software requirements development emerge through classification of the conceptualizations of expressions elicited via the repertory grid interviews. Repertory grid also reveals, through cluster analysis, the subtle difference in the way each participant conceptually related one expression to another expression. The differences in conceptual relationship of expressions or concepts could represent insight about how people view entities of a lifeworld.

There were in total, nine quality controlled SGs that were functional for shorter or longer periods of time. Their typology and functionality is described. Quality SGs have evolved and the role of classification has changed accordingly from supporting subject organization on the interface and automatic categorization of resources, towards supporting a semantic linking, control and vocabulary mapping between different indexing systems in subject hubs and federated SGs. In this period, many SGs ceased to exist and little information remains available regarding their status. SGs currently using UDC, for some part of their resource organization, do not use a UDC subject hierarchy at the interface and its role in resource indexing has become more difficult to observe. Since 2000, UDC has become more prevalent in East European SGs, portals and hubs, which are outside the scope of this research.

Current research questions in KO are dominated by a noteworthy interest in quality, related not only to the informational contents recorded in knowledge organization systems (KOS) but also to technical and technological considerations. The integration of knowledge would seem to constitute a quality indicator present in most proposals, and it also responds to the need for KOS with frameworks comprehensible for all user sectors, respecting the diversity of users. The flip side of knowledge integration entails the conjugation of technical, formal and technological aspects, well represented by the word interoperability, or the search for a way to simplify and harmonize the great variety of structures and formats that coexist in the Internet. This paper addresses the aforementioned major research concerns expressed in the last decade of KO literature. It is structured into two broad sections: 1) A demand for quality, touching on research questions related to multilingualism, cross-culturalism, social groups, minorities and ethics, as well as the integration of structures, forms and formats and the respective proposals by scholars; and 2) A demand for managing emergent knowledge in KOS, with a discussion of how to represent and organize work-oriented and organizational knowledge domains, where multidimensional knowledge (multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinarity) is addressed together with the responses put forth by various researchers.",Cluster 6

In this paper, focused on hierarchical relations, different aspects of the relational semantics of thesauri, and among them the possibility of developing richer structures, are analyzed. Thesauri are viewed as semantic tools providing, for operational purposes, the representation of the meaning of the terms. The paper stresses how theories of semantics, holding different perspectives about the nature of meaning and how it is represented, affect the design of the relational semantics of thesauri. The need for tools capable of representing the complexity of knowledge and of the semantics of terms as it occurs in the literature of their respective subject fields is advocated.

We briefly introduce the beginning and principles of folksonomy and discuss the categorizing concept of folksonomies on the basis of the computer program delicious. The selection of the metadata tagged is not accidental, rather tagging follows a pattern that proves to be the pattern for the classic power law, which, in many complex systems is seen to unfold as an imitation-dynamic that creates an asymmetry, where a few descriptive metadata are often reproduced and the majority seldom reproduced. In del.icio.us, it is the very broadband basic subject headings that are often reproduced and achieve power in the system - which in cognitive psychology is called cognitive basic categories - while the small, more specific subject headings are seldom reproduced. The law of power's underlying imitation-dynamic in del.icio.us is explained from the perspective of different theoretical paradigms, i.e. network, economy and cognition. The theorectical and speculative conclusion is that the law of power and asymmetry is biased by a cognitive economizing through a simplification principle in the users' construction of descriptive metadata. Free tagging in folksonomies is comparable to empirical experiments in free categorization. Users often choose broad basic categories, because that requires the least cognitive effort. The consequences are that folksonomy is not necessarily a better, more realistic and cheaper method of creating metadata than that which can be generated through taxonomies, faceted classification or search algorithms.

While the design and construction of controlled vo-cabularies have been prescribed at the technical level in great detail over the past decades, the methodological level has been somewhat neglected. However, classification research has in recent years focused on developing approaches to the analysis of users, domains, and activities that could produce requirements for the design of controlled vocabularies. Researchers have of-ten argued that the design, construction, and use of controlled vocabularies need to be based on analyses and understandings of the contexts in which these controlled vocabularies function. While one would assume that the growing body of research on human information behavior might help guide the development of controlled vocabularies shed light on these contexts, unfor-tunately, much of the research in this area is descriptive in nature and of little use for systems design. This paper discusses these trends and outlines a holistic approach that demonstrates how the design of controlled vocabularies can be informed by inves-tigations of people’s interactions with information. This approach is based on the Cognitive Work Analysis framework and outlines several dimensions of human-information interactions. Application of this approach will result is a comprehensive un-derstanding of the contexts in which the controlled vocabulary will function and which can be used for the development of for the development of controlled vocabularies.",Cluster 2

Therefore, a definition of the concept of Representation of knowledge is indispensable. The term representation has been used in western cultural and intellectual tradition to refer to the diverse ways that a subject comprehends an object. Representation is a process which requires the structure of natural language and human memory whereby it is interwoven in a subject and in conscience. However, at the present time, the term Representation of knowledge is applied to the processing of electronic information, combined with the aim of emulating the human mind in such a way that one has endeavoured to transfer, with great difficulty, the complex structurality of the conceptual representation of human knowledge to new digital information technologies. Thus, nowadays, representation of knowledge has taken on diverse meanings and it has focussed, for the moment, on certain structures and conceptual hierarchies which carry and transfer information, and has initially been based on the current representation of knowledge using artificial intelligence. The traditional languages of documentation, also referred to as languages of representation, offer a structured representation of conceptual fields, symbols and terms of natural and notational language, and they are the pillars for the necessary correspondence between the object or text and its representation. These correspondences, connections and symbolisations will be established within the electronic framework by means of different models and of the goal domain, which will give rise to organisations, structures, maps, networks and levels, as new electronic documents are not compact units but segments of information.

Gnoli, Claudio. Classification Transcends Library Business. Knowledge Organization, 37(3), 223-229. 26 references. Abstract: Although bibliographic classifications usually adopt a perspective different from that of object classifications, the two have obvious relationships. These become especially relevant when users are looking for knowledge scattered in a wide va- riety of forms and media. This is an increasingly common situation, as library catalogues now coexist in the global digital envi- ronment with catalogues of archives, of museums, of commercial products, and many other information resources. In order to make the subject content of all these resources searchable, a broader conception of classification is needed, that can be applied to any knowledge item, rather than only bibliographic materials. To illustrate this we take an example of the research on bag- pipes in Northern Italian folklore. For this kind of research, the most effective search strategy is a cross-media one, looking for many different knowledge sources such as published documents, police archives, painting details, museum specimens, organi- zations devoted to related subjects. To provide satisfying results for this kind of search, the traditional disciplinary approach to classification is not sufficient. Tools are needed in which knowledge items dealing with a phenomenon of interest can be re- trieved independently from the other topics with which it is combined, the disciplinary context, and the medium where it oc- curs. This can be made possible if the basic units of classification are taken to be the phenomena treated, as recommended in the Leon Manifesto, rather than disciplines or other aspect features. The concept of bagpipes should be retrievable and browsable in any combination with other phenomena, disciplines, media etc. Examples are given of information sources that could be managed by this freely-faceted technique of classification.",Cluster 6

031-650-207-787-672,"In the last two decades of knowledge organization (KO) research, there has been an increasing interest in the context-dependent nature of human knowledge. Contextualism maintains that knowledge is not available in a neutral and objective way, but is always interwoven with the process of knowledge production and the prerequisites of the knower. As a first step towards a systematic organization of epistemic contexts, the concept of knowledge will be considered in its onto- logical (WHAT) and epistemological (WHO) including methodological (HOW) dimensions. In current KO research, however, either the contextualism is not fully implemented (classification-as-ontology) or the ambition for a context-transcending universal KOS seems to have been abandoned (classification-as-epistemology). Based on a combined ontology and epistemology it will be argued that a phenom- ena-based approach to KO as stipulated by the Leon Manifesto, for example, requires a revision of the underlying phenomenon concept as a relation between the known object (WHAT) and the knowing subject (WHO), which is constituted by the application of specific meth- ods (HOW). While traditional subject indexing of documents often relies on the organizing principle ""levels of being"" (WHAT), for a fu- ture context indexing, two novel principles are proposed, namely ""levels of knowing"" (WHO) and ""integral methodological pluralism"" (HOW).",Cluster 6

One far-reaching provision seems to be the use of a subdivision of a preferred heading with all of its NTs. Thus, every preferred heading is a potential key heading for all of its NTs.

As a consequence, the use of tags to browse information resources requires moving from one resource to another, based on coincidence and not on the pre-established meaningful or logical connections that may exist between related resources. We suggest that the semantic structure of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) may be used in complementing and supporting tag-based browsing.

ABSTRACT: The spread of many new media and formats is changing the scenario faced by knowledge organizers: as printed monographs are not the only standard form of knowledge carrier anymore, the traditional kind of knowl- edge organization (KO) systems based on academic disciplines is put into question. A sounder foundation can be provided by an analysis of the different dimensions concurring to form the content of any knowledge item—what Brian Vickery described as the steps ""from the world to the classifier."" The ultimate referents of documents are the phenomena of the real world, that can be ordered by ontology, the study of what exists. Phenomena coexist in subjects with the perspectives by which they are considered, pertaining to epistemology, and with the formal features of knowledge carriers, adding a further, pragmatic layer. All these di- mensions can be accounted for in metadata, but are often done so in mixed ways, making indexes less rigorous and interoperable. For example, while facet analysis was originally developed for subject indexing, many ""faceted"" interfaces today mix subject fac- ets with form facets, and schemes presented as ""ontologies"" for the ""semantic Web"" also code for non-semantic information. In bibliographic classifications, phenomena are often confused with the disciplines dealing with them, the latter being assumed to be the most useful starting point, for users will have either one or another perspective. A general citation order of dimensions— phenomena, perspective, carrier—is recommended, helping to concentrate most relevant information at the beginning of head- ings.",Cluster 2

The model of scale-free networks, which has been recently developed and widely applied since, can be effectively used in terminology research as well. Operation based on the principle of networks is a universal characteristic of complex systems. Networks are governed by general laws. The model of scale-free networks can be viewed as a statistical-probability model, and it can be described with mathematical tools. Its main feature is that ‘everything is connected to everything else’, that is every node is reachable (in a few steps) starting from any other node; this phenomena called ‘the small world phenomenon’. The existence of a linguistic network and the general laws of the operation of networks enable us to place issues of language use in the complex system of relations that reveal the deeper connections between phenomena with the help of networks embedded in each other. The realization of the metaphor that language also has a network structure is the basis of the classification methods of the terminological system, and likewise of the ways of creating terminology databases, which serve the purpose of providing easy and versatile accessibility to specialised knowledge.",Cluster 2

However, it is worth asking what kind of semantics we can find in the Semantic Web, considering that studying the subject is a complex and controversial endeavour. Working within this context, we present an account of semantics relying on the main linguist approaches, in order to then analyze what semantics is within the scope of information technology. We critically evaluate a spectrum, which proposes the ordination of instruments (models, languages, taxonomic structures, to mention but a few) according to a semantic scale.

103-364-820-610-122,"Any ontological theory commits us to accept and classify a number of phenomena in a more or less specific way – and vice versa: a classification tends to reveal the theoretical outlook of its creator. Objects and their descriptions and relations are not just “given” but determined by theories. Knowledge is fallible and consensus is rare. By implication, knowledge organization has to consider different theories/views and their foundations. Bibliographical classifications depend on subject knowledge and on the same theories as corresponding scientific and scholarly classifications. Some classifications are based on logical distinctions, others on empirical examinations, and some on mappings of common ancestors or on establishing functional criteria. To evaluate a classification is to involve oneself in the research which has produced the given classification. Because research is always based more or less on specific epistemological ideals (e.g. empiricism, rationalism, historicism or pragmatism), the evaluation of classification includes the evaluation of the epistemological foundations of the research on which given classifications have been based. The field of knowledge organization itself is based on different approaches and traditions such as user-based and cognitive views, facet-analytical views, numeric taxonomic approaches, bibliometrics and domain-analytic approaches.

Instead, the weight of social discipline among members of sexual subcultures themselves helps to create these classifications, often reflecting the nomenclature of subjects and desires within sexual subcultures in a complex relationship to a dominant culture. Critically examining two benchmarks in the development of sexual nomenclature within queer subcultures, this paper finds its evidence in George Chauncey's little known analysis (1985) of a navy investigation of male homosexuality at the Newport Naval Training Station during the World War I era and in contemporary folksonomic classifi- cations of representations of queer desire within Xtube, a database of online pornography. Social discipline within these sexual sub- cultures occurs in the stabilization of nomenclature through socialization and through members' overt intervention into each oth- ers' self-understanding. Both the Newport and Xtube evidence also reveals a complex social and cultural structure among members of sexual subcultures by drawing our attention to the particularity of various modes of sexual being and the relationship between those modes and particular configurations of sexual identity. In the process, this paper allows us to reassess, first, a presupposition of folksonomies as free of discipline allowing for their emancipatory potential and, second, the prevailing binary understandings of authority in the development of sexual nomenclatures and classifications as either top-down or bottom-up.",Cluster 4

A more collaborative approach would entail a change in the role of professionals and in the goals and values of the systems. This paper explores the notion of authority and the role of professionals in a changing environment where more people participate in the organization and repre- sentation of information and knowledge. The paper questions the traditional role of the professionals and argues that systems must be designed to facilitate trust and authority, and that the authority of folksonomies and systems comes from the users' collective interpretations and meaning production.",Cluster 1

Biology has really become an information science; and, as such, it is also inspiring new ways of thinking and new kinds of knowledge paradigms beyond those discussed during past decades. In this regard, a new ""bioinformational"" approach to the inter-multi-disciplinary relationships among the sciences will be proposed herein: scientomics. Biologically inspired, scientomics contemplates the multifarious interactions between scientific disciplines from the ""knowledge recombination"" vantage point. In their historical expansion, the sciences would have recapitulated upon collective cognitive dynamics already realized along the evolutionary expansion of living systems, mostly by means of domain recombination processes within cellular genomes, but also occurring neurally inside the ""cerebral workspace"" of human brains and advanced mammals. Scientomics, understood as a new research field in the domain of knowledge organization, would capture the ongoing processes of scientific expansion and recombination by means of genomic inspired software (like in the new field of culturomics). It would explain the peculiar interaction maps of the sciences (scientometrics) as well as the increasing complexity of research amidst scientific and technological cumulative achievements.

We confront the current debates within the KO community about the relevance of universal bibliographic classifications and the thesaurus in the web with the ongoing discussions about the epistemological and methodological assumptions underlying data-driven inquiry. In essence, Big Data will not remove the need for humanly-constructed KOSs. However, ongoing transformations in knowledge production processes entailed by Big Data and web 2.0 put pressure on the KO community to rethink the standpoint from which KOSs are designed. Essentially, the field of KO needs to move from laying down the apodictic (that which we know for all time) to adapting to the new world of social and natural scientific knowledge by creating maximally flexible schemas – faceted rather than Aristotelean classifications. KO also needs to adapt to the changing nature of output in the social and natural sciences, to the extent that these in turn are being affected by the advent of Big Data. Theoretically, this entails a shift from purely universalist and normative top-down approaches to more descriptive bottom-up approaches that can be inclusive of diverse viewpoints.

068-575-306-450-958,"Modelling bibliographical entities is a prominent activity within knowledge organization today. Current models of bibliographic entities, such as Functional Requirements for Bibliographical Records (FRBR) and the Bibliographic Framework (BIBFRAME), take inspiration from data-modelling methods developed by computer scientists from the mid-1970s on. Thus, it would seem that the modelling of bibliographic entities is an activity of very recent vintage. However, it is possible to find examples of bibliographical models from earlier periods of knowledge organization. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to one such model, outlined by the early 20th-century British classification theorist E. Wyndham Hulme in his essay on “Principles of Book Classification” (1911–1912). There, Hulme set forth a classification of various attributes by which books can conceivably be classified. These he first divided into accidental and inseparable attributes. Accidental attributes were subdivided into edition-level and copy-level attributes and inseparable attitudes, into physical and non-physical attributes. Comparison of Hulme’s classification of attributes with those of FRBR and BIBFRAME 2.0 reveals that the different classes of attributes in Hulme’s classification correspond to groups of attributes associated with different bibliographical entities in those models. These later models assume the existence of different bibliographic entities in an abstraction hierarchy among which attributes are distributed, whereas Hulme posited only a single entity— the book—, whose various aspects he clustered into different classes of attributes.

And yet, a question still seems unanswered: how was its literature classified and retrieved? It is a subject that has been given surprisingly little attention by the field of library-and-information science―indeed, by scholarship in general. Furthermore, a certain way of thinking has influenced the few answers that have so far been attempted. It is as if the scholars of our era have tried to identify the modern, physical library in the Hellenistic library in Alexandria. But such an approach is biased in a basic way: It simply does not consider the impact of the cultural and intellectual context of the library. This article differs fundamentally, because I reject the notion that the library was like those of today. Accordingly, an entirely new way of understanding how the library actually worked, in terms of classification and retrieval processes is presented. The key element is to understand the library both as a physical structure and as a struc- ture in the memory of the Alexandrian scholars. In this article, these structures are put together so as to propose a new interpretation of the library.",Cluster 2

From the very beginning, UDC was designed to represent the universe of knowledge as an integral whole allowing for subjects/concepts from all fields of knowledge to be combined, linked and the nature of their relationships made explicit. In Otlet's original design, the emphasis for his new type of classification was on the coordination of classmarks at the point of searching, i.e., post-coordination, which he firmly rooted in an expressive notational system. While some UDC classes exhibit various patterns of facet analytical theory proper, others, although used in an analytico-synthetic fashion, follow less canonical structural patterns. The authors highlight the lack of connection made throughout the various stages of UDC restructuring between: a) theoretical requirements of an overarching facet analytical theory as a founding principle guiding the construction of schedules; and, b) practical requirements for an analytico-synthetic classification in terms of notational presentation and data structure that enables its use in indexing and retrieval, as well as its management online.",Cluster 6

Debates persist as to whether thesauri and manual indexing or automated machine learning techniques should be used to enhance discovery of information. In addition, the extent to which a Knowledge Organization System (KOS) enhances discoveries or indeed blinds us to new ones remains a moot point. The oil and gas industry is used as a case study using a representative organization. Drawing on prior research, a theoretical model is presented which aims to overcome the shortcomings of each approach.

Facet analysis is used to examine this area of music classification and as the basis of a model for classifying ensembles. The conceptual analysis is aided by examples drawn from two classification schemes, British Catalogue of Music Classification (BCMC) and Flexible Classification. First, this exploration reveals that there are conceptually four sub-facets for classifying instrument ensembles, and that the omission of any of these sub-facets causes issues within classification schemes. Next, the different type of relationships between pairs of these sub-facets is delineated, including hierarchical and associative relationships. The classification of ensembles is depicted in a novel way, as a series of inter-connected relationships between sub-facets. Finally, the article ascertains exactly what is being counted, including introducing potential extra sets of sub-facets pertaining to performers and hands. So, facet analysis helps to create a model for classifying instrumental ensembles which provides a novel solution to this historically problematic area of music classification, as well as suggesting a potentially generalizable new way of thinking about complex relationships between sub-facets",Cluster 4

It models the tourism ontology in such a way that it is able to deal with the context of a tourist’s information need with precision. This is evident from the result that more than 90% of the user’s queries were successfully met. The use of domain knowledge and techniques from both library and information science and computer science has helped in the realization of the desired purpose of this ontology construction process.

Traditional fiction indexing has been mainly based on the factual aspects of the work; this has then been expanded to handle different aspects of the fictional work.

The participants felt that reclassifying the library’s fiction collection by genre gave students more ownership of the fiction collection and allowed them to find materials that genuinely interested them.

Specifically, we argue that, the improvement of detection of some classes of low-level features in images music and video can be used in conjunction with knowledge organization to tag or label multimedia content for better retrieval performance. We provide an overview of the use of knowledge organization schemes in machine learning and make recommendations to information professionals on the use of this technology with knowledge organization techniques to solve multimedia IR problems. We introduce a five-step process model that extracts features from multimedia objects (Step 1) from both knowledge organization (Step 1a) and machine learning (Step 1b), merging them together (Step 2) to create an index of those multimedia objects (Step 3). We also overview further steps in creating an application to utilize the multimedia objects (Step 4) and maintaining and updating the database of features on those objects (Step 5). </p>",Cluster 6

A work consists of abstract intellectual content that is distinct from any object that is its carrier. In library and information science, the importance of the work lies squarely with the problem of information retrieval. Works are mentefacts-intellectual (or mental) constructs that serve as artifacts of the cultures in which they arise. The meaning of a work is abstract at every level, from its creator’s conception of it, to its reception and inherence by its consumers. Works are a kind of informing object and are subject to the phenomenon of instantiation, or realization over time. Research has indicated a base typology of instantiation. The problem for information retrieval is to simultaneously collocate and disambiguate large sets of instantiations. Cataloging and bibliographc tradition stipulate an alphabetico-classed arrangement of works based on an authorship principle.

066-382-980-653-77X,"<p>Charles Peirce’s classification of the sciences was designed shortly after the turn of the twentieth century. The classification has two main sources of inspiration: Comte’s science classification and Kant’s theoretical philosophy. Peirce’s classification, like that of Comte, is hierarchically organised in that the more general and abstract sciences provide principles for the less general and more concrete sciences. However, Peirce includes and assigns a superordinate role to philosophical disciplines which analyse and provide logical, methodological and ontological principles for the specialised sciences, and which are based on everyday life experience. Moreover, Peirce recognises two main branches of specialised empirical science: the natural sciences, on the one hand, and the social sciences, the humanities and psychology on the other. While both branches share logical and methodological principles, they are based on different ontological principles in studying physical nature and the human mind and its products, respectively. Peirce’s most basic philosophical discipline, phenomenology, transforms his early engagement with Kant. Peirce’s classification of aesthetics, ethics and logic as normative sub-disciplines of philosophy relate to his philosophical pragmatism. Yet his more overarching division between theoretical (philosophical and specialised) sciences and practical sciences may be seen as problematic. Taking Peirce’s historical account of scientific developments into consideration, however, I argue that his science classification and its emphasis on the interdependencies between the sciences could be seen as sustaining and supporting interdisciplinarity and interaction across fields of research, even across the divide between theoretical and practical sciences. </p>",Cluster 2

Historically, the principle of provenance is a pivotal moment in the development of archival theory, crucial to understanding the nature of records and archives. However, in archival theory, the principle of provenance still does not correspond to a single term or a single definition and scarce normalization terminology remains one of the problems of archival science, which leads to a lack of consensus about the division between the two principles of provenance and original order.

The authors have each independently applied this term in slightly different contexts and scales (Hauser 2018a; Tennis 2016), and this article presents a unified definition of the term and guidelines for applying it at the scale of both words and works. The resulting weak concept of aboutness is pragmatic, in Star’s sense of a focus on consequences over antecedents, while reserving space for the critique and improvement of aboutness determinations within various contexts and research programs. The paper finishes with a discussion of the implication of the concept of episemantics and methodological possibilities it offers for knowledge organization research and practice. We draw inspiration from Melvil Dewey’s use of physical aroundness in his first classification system and ask how aroundness might be more effectively operationalized in digital environments. </p>",Cluster 5
152-347-604-820-830,"<p>The Basics Concept Classification (BCC) is a “universal” scheme: it attempts to encompass all areas of human understanding. Whereas most universal schemes are organized around scholarly disciplines, the BCC is instead organized around phenomena (things), the relationships that exist among phenomena, and the properties that phenomena and relators may possess. This structure allows the BCC to apply facet analysis without requiring the use of “facet indicators.” The main motivation for the BCC was a recognition that existing classifications that are organized around disciplines serve interdisciplinary scholarship poorly. Complex concepts that might be understood quite differently across groups and individuals can generally be broken into basic concepts for which there is enough shared understanding for the purposes of classification. Documents, ideas, and objects are classified synthetically by combining entries from the schedules of phenomena, relators, and properties. The inclusion of separate schedules of-generally verb-like-relators is one of the most unusual aspects of the BCC. This (and the schedules of properties that serve as adjectives or adverbs) allows the production of sentence-like subject strings. Documents can then be classified in terms of the main arguments made in the document. BCC provides very precise descriptors of documents by combining phenomena, relators, and properties synthetically. The terminology employed in the BCC reduces terminological ambiguity. The BCC is still being developed and it needs to be fleshed out in certain respects. Yet it also needs to be applied; only in application can the feasibility and desirability of the classification be adequately assessed. </p>",Cluster 6
173-877-453-721-519,"<p>By using the metadata for the fonds of “Chen Cheng-po’s Paintings and Documents” (CCP) in the database of the Archives of the Institute of Taiwan History (IHT, Academia Sinica, Taiwan), we develop and enhance a semantic data model for converting the data into a linked data project, focusing on data modeling, data reconciliation, and data enrichment. The research questions are: 1) How can we keep the original rich and contextual information of the archival materials during a LOD task?; 2) How can we integrate heterogeneous datasets about the same real-world resources from libraries, archives, and museums, while keeping the different views distinct?; and, (3) How can we provide added value for semantic metadata of archives in terms of instance-based and schema-based types of enrichment? The project adopts the Europeana Data Model (EDM) as the main model and extends the properties to fit the contextual characteristics of archival materials. Various methods are explored to preserve the hierarchical structure and context of the archival materials, to enrich semantic data, and to connect data from different sources and institutions. We propose four approaches to enriching data semantics by: 1) directly using external vocabularies; 2) reconciling local links to other linked data sources; 3) introducing contextual classes for the appropriate contextual entities; and, 4) utilizing named entity extraction. The results can contribute to the best practice for developing linked data for art-related archival materials. </p>",Cluster 5
187-701-961-076-877,"Knowledge organization (KO) is considered a distinctive disciplinary focus of information science, with strong connections to other intellectual domains such as philosophy, computer science, psychology, sociology, and more. Given its inherent interdisciplinarity, we ask what might a map of the physical, cultural and intellectual geography of the KO community look like? Who is participating in this discipline’s scholarly discussion, and from what locations, both geographically and intellectually? Using the unit of authorship in the journal Knowledge Organization, where is the nexus of KO activity, and what patterns of authorship can be identified? What indices can be generated to describe the KO community of researchers as it has evolved? Cultural characteristics were applied as a lens to explore who is and is not participating in the international conversation about KO. World Bank GNI per capita estimates were used to compare relative wealth of countries and Hofstede’s Individualism dimension was identified as a way of understanding attributes of countries whose scholars are participating in this dialog. Descriptive statistics were generated through Excel, and data visualizations were rendered through Tableau Public and TagCrowd. The current project offers one method for examining an international and interdisciplinary field of study, but also suggests potential for analyzing other interdisciplinary areas within the larger discipline of information science.",Cluster 2
