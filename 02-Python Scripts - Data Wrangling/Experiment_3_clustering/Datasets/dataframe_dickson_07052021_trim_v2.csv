As a secondary topic the scientific relations existing among Information Science, Epistemology, and the Cognitive Sciences are discussed. Classification is seen as a central activity in all daily and scientific activities, and, of course, of knowledge organization in information services. There is a mutual implication between classification and conceptualization, as the former moves in a natural way to the latter and the best result elaborated for classification is the concept. Research in concept theory is a need for a Theory of Classification. In this direction it is of outstanding importance to integrate the achievements of natural concept formation theory (NCFT) as an alternative approach to conceptualization different from the traditional one of logicians and problem solving researchers.

This lack of systematic documentation severely handicaps all historical research that involves the interpretation of iconographic detail. It leaves us unable to count the frequency with which subjects have been represented, or with which iconographic particularities occur. This article asks whether the use of the iconographic classification system ICONCLASS will help to create countable iconographic information.

In addition to the important distinctions between the fundamental concepts and terms (tags) used in Onomantics and Terminology, as reported in the first two parts of this essay, several other interesting comparisons can be made. First, with reference to formats, both the structure and nomenclature used for terminological entries (records) in ISO 1087 parallel those found in dictionaries and suggest a semantic rather than an onomantic point of view. Second, a large number of borrowed terms taken from Lexicography and Linguistics can be found in this glossary for the terminology of Terminology. Sometimes the definitions for these terms identify them as borrowed concepts drawn from the vocabulary used by lexicographers. However, sometimes new meanings are stipulated for these terms without any markings to show that they are not borrowed concepts. Moreover, in all these cases, since the original and the newly stipulated concepts are similar, ambiguity is unavoidable. Third, some concepts that might be useful for terminologists are not included in ISO 1087: a few examples are explained. They are all concepts which lexicographers do not need and, consequently, they have no terms for them. It seems apparent that they have been omitted from the vocabulary of Terminology simply because they are new concepts without established terms. To explain the reasons for the formats, terms and omissions found in the leading glossary for the terminology of Terminology takes us into a realm of speculation that is too complicated for inclusion here, but I will discuss it in Part IV of this series, with a focus on the problems of neologisms",third seri articl publish 1996 25 follow 1997 addit import distinct fundament concept tag use onomant terminolog report first essay sever interest comparison made first refer format structur nomenclatur use terminolog entri record iso parallel found dictionari suggest semant rather onomant view second larg number borrow taken lexicographi linguist found glossari terminolog terminolog sometim definit identifi borrow concept drawn vocabulari use lexicograph howev sometim new mean stipul without mark show borrow concept moreov case sinc origin newli stipul concept similar ambigu unavoid third concept might use terminologist iso exampl explain concept lexicograph consequ seem appar omit vocabulari terminolog simpli new concept without establish explain reason format omiss found lead glossari terminolog terminolog take realm specul complic inclus discuss seri focu problem neolog

To begin with, a few basic concepts from the field of communication theory are defined. The new concepts permit the conclusion that what we are facing at present is not a flood of information but one of messages, and that this latter flood must not be equated indiscriminately with a knowledge flood. Messages must be judged on their contents. To this end, «knowledge» is subdivided into «core-», «peripheral», and «pseudo-knowledge», and it is argued that the great majority of scientific publications contains peripheral and pseudoknowledge. With the aid of two interlocking and self-amplying recursive mechanisms it is shown that and how pseudoknowledge is more and more gaining disciplines, hence precisely in those fields which deal with social problems in the broadest sense of the world; Thus a deficit of knowledge on which to base action is produced, leading to a general disorientation - a modern form of ignorance, keenly manifesting it self at present in a crisis of leadership.

The linkage deals with establishing the proper correspondences between components of the base and the representing part. Each of these knowledge kinds is associated with specific structures related to concepts (symbols, names, statements, images, texts, entities and their properties and relations, procedures of determination of property values, etc.).

This applicability has repeatedly been viewed as being just a miracle. One major idea to diminsh the miraculous impression was to view mathematics as exploring the vast area ofall kinds ofabstract structures, thus establishing a huge store of humanly possible thinking from which the physicist has only to choose the structure appropriate for the case before him. There remains, however, the problem of mathematical overdetermination ofphysics: the structures suitable for application usually contain mathematical elements that remain without physical interpretation.

This paper approaches the language problem from just the opposite side: the given is here a certain content; what is sought for, is an appropriate artificial language to represent this content. To this end, seven elementary representation principles are proposed. To illustrate the way they work, syntactic pattern recognition is introduced as a simple, but non-trivial example for representing knowledge in formal language. Another central thema of the paper is LEIBNIZ's characteristica universalis and the so-called LEIBNIZ project. LEIBNIZ's investigations in this field are reviewed against the background of the tasks required in syntactic pattern recognition. It is demonstrated that LEIBNIZ had, in fact, already worked with six ofthe seven representation principles proposed, further, that his characteristica universalis is an early form of a formal language, and lastly, that - contrary to the prevailing view - the LEIBNIZ project is not a matter of logic but rather one of knowledge representation, a field largely unexploited in today's logic-oriented epistemology and philosophy of science. It is precisely this one-sided orientation of these disciplines, which is responsible for the distorted picture of LEIBNIZ's work found in the literature; some typical misunderstandings are finally discussed.

It progresses by association, affinity and juxtaposition of two divergent ideas in an integrative approach. To argue a case, a legal expert cannot limit himself to the perception of isolated facts, but instead must find affinities between fields expressing more cohesion in law. In this paper, it is argued that the legal specialist relies on abstract categorization to discover a precedent and thereby create a metaphorical link that serves in the argumentation stage, and also later on in the resolution of the case. On this basis, a model of case reasoning is charted that integrates a model of analogical reasoning. In the same manner, a model of analogical reasoning is designed that combines quality induction and deduction. Furthermore, it is advocated that a rich representation of a law category is required to make a good induction. Similarly, it is specified that quality induction should be constrained by abstract rules in order to preserve legal principles and compute profound similarity between cases to discover the precedent.

47,092-264-638-820-590,Test Case,"Traditionally, database indexing and book indexing have been looked upon as being quite distinct and have been kept apart in textbooks and teaching. The traditional borderline between both variations of indexing, however, should not conceal fundamental commonalities of the two approaches. For example, thesaurus construction and usage, quite common in databases, has hardly been encountered in book indexing so far. Database indexing, on the other hand, has hardly made use of subheadings of the syntax-displaying type, quite common in book indexing. Most database users also prefer precombining vocabulary units and reject concept analysis. However, insisting on precombining descriptors in a large database vocabulary may, in the long run, well be destructive to the quality of indexing and of the searches. A complementary approach is conceivable which provides both precombinations and analyzed subjects, both index language syntax and subheadings, and provides access to an information system via precombinations, without jeopardizing the manageability of the vocabulary. Such an approach causes considerable costs in input because it involves a great deal of intellectual work. On the other hand, much time and costs will be saved in the use of the system.

Symbol manipulation systems had been considered by Leibniz as a methodology of inferring knowledge in a secure and purely mechanical fashion. Such inference calculi were considered as mere artefacts which could not possibly encompass all human knowledge acquisition. In Alan Turing's work one notices a crucial shift of perspective. The abstract mathematical states of a Turing machine (a kind of calculus universalis that Leibniz was looking for) are claimed to correspond to equivalent psychological states. Artefacts are turned into faithful models of human cognition. A further step toward the Computational Theory of Mind was the physical symbol system hypothesis, contending to have found a necessary and sufficient criterion for the presence of intelligence in operative mediums. This, together with Chomsky's foundational work on linguistics, led naturally to the Computational Theory of Mind as set out by Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn. We discuss problematic aspects of this theory. Then we deal with another paradigm of the Computational Theory of Mind based on network automata.

With his recent death, it is time to sequence the innovation cycle, some of whose parts he had detailed. A Kuhnian discovery faces battle before it is can even be tried and evaluated. We enumerate over two dozen way-stations, or phases, many heretofore vaguely differentiated in half a dozen academic disciplines. Each phase is illustrated with a vignette. Within that cycle, the mental awareness that one has found an anomaly is a distinct advantage, for which we propose the name of neocognition. Certain phases are especially vulnerable dead ends, choke-points, of the entire sequence. Particularly so are the 8 th to 10 th periods - the cultural reactions based on the perceived immediacy of benefit. Any requirement to obtain commercial support at this pre-development stage prevents the emergence of even farsighted latent support that could hurdle the remaining steps.

The major systems that have predominated during the twentieth century were originally predicated on the academic disciplines. This structural principle is no longer adequate because multidisciplinary knowledge production has overtaken more traditional disciplinary perspectives and produced communities of cooperation whose documents cannot be accommodated in a disciplinary structure. This paper addresses the problems the major classifications face, reports some attempts to revise these systems to accommodate multidisciplinary works more appropriately, and describes some theoretical research perspectives that attempt to reorient classification research toward the pluralistic needs of multidisciplinary knowledge creation and the perspectives of different discourse communities. Traditionally, the primary desiderata of classification systems were mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity.

54,099-934-645-088-072,Test Case,"Parts I to III of this series have examined the terminology of Terminology by contrast with the vocabulary of Onomantics and identified some of the differences and difficulties revealed by a close study of ISO-1087, the most important glossary for terminologists. Part IV, finally, offers a speculative explanation of these problems. My central hypothesis is that an aversion to neologisms - especially newly coined words - impedes the introduction and acceptance of new concepts. The pressure for standardization of terminology compounds this difficulty. There are three kinds of neologisms: 1. newly coined words (neoterisms), 2. phases composed of familiar words (phrasal tags) and 3. familiar words for which new meanings have been stipulated (meta-terms). Neologisms in the form of phrases containing familiar words are often found in ISO 1087. Some perplexing ambiguities in ISO 1087 occur when new meanings are stipulated for familiar words, creating terminological metaphors (meta-terms) that are often obscure. Such meta-terms abound in the terminology of Terminology. Increased willingness to accept well-formed new words (neoterisms) would greatly simplify the development of a more adequate terminology for Terminology. The use of pleonasms is recommended as a technique to overcome ambiguity by linking familiar words having new meanings (meta-terms) to new words for the same concepts (neoterisms) and as a simple way to facilitate the introduction of such neoterisms.",seri examin terminolog terminolog contrast vocabulari onomant identifi difficulti reveal close iso import glossari terminologist final offer specul explan problem central hypothesi avers neolog especi newli coin word imped introduct accept new concept pressur standard terminolog compound difficulti kind neolog newli coin word neoter phase compos familiar word phrasal tag familiar word new mean stipul meta neolog form phrase contain familiar word often found iso perplex ambigu iso occur new mean stipul familiar word creat terminolog metaphor meta often obscur meta abound terminolog terminolog increas willing accept form new word neoter greatli simplifi adequ terminolog terminolog use pleonasm recommend techniqu overcom ambigu link familiar word new mean meta new word concept neoter simpl facilit introduct neoter

Such databases contain fulltext (or other kinds of documents, e.g. pic- tures) and/or document representations and/or different kinds of ""value added information"". The core theoretical problem for IS is re- lated to the determination of the usefulness of different ""subject access points"" in electronic databases. This problem is again related to theories of meaning and semantics.2 This paper outlines some important principles in the design of documents done in the field of ""composition studies"". It maps the possible subject access points and presents research done on each kind of these. It shows how theories of IR must build on or relate to different theories of concepts and meaning. It discusses two contrasting theories of semantics worked out by Ludwig Wittgenstein: ""the picture theory"" and ""the theory of language games"" and demonstrates the different consequences for such theories for IR.

Maria Theresia Rolland proposes such a model in her book ,,Sprachverarbeitung durch Logotechnik (1994). Relying upon the language theory of Leo Weisgerber, she pursues a pure ,,content oriented approach, by which she understands an approach in terms of the semantics of words. Starting from the ,,implications of word-contents, she attempts to construct a complete grammar of the German language. The reviewer begins his comments with an immanent critique, calling attention to a number of serious contradictions in Rolland's concept, among them, her refusal to take syntax into account despite its undeniably real presence. In the second part of his comments, the reviewer then takes up his own semiotic language theory published in 1981, showing that semantics is but one of four semiotic dimensions of language, the other dimensions being the sigmatic, the pragmatic and the syntactic. Without taking all four dimensions into account, no theory can offer an adequate integrative language model. Indeed, without all four dimensions, one cannot even develop an adequate grammar of German sentence construction. The fourfold semiotic model discloses as well the universally valid structures of language as the intersubjective expression of human self-awareness. Only on the basis of these universal structures, it is argued, is it possible to identify the specific structures of a native-language, and that on all four levels.

To compare concepts (not words) in an Onomantic (Ana-Semantic, or concept-to-tag) context, one needs to compare the descriptions (definitions) of each concept to see whether they, indeed, have the same or different essential characteristics. One also needs to compare the notations that situate each concept in a system - even if the definitions of two concepts are almost the same, one might discover that because two concepts are positioned differently in their respective classification schemes, they are conceptualized differently.

88,194-556-078-156-224,Test Case,"Different approaches to the classification of a knowledge field include empiristic, rationalistic, historicist, and pragmatic methods. This paper demonstrates how these different methods have been applied to the classification of psychology. An etymological approach is insufficient to define the subject matter of psychology, because other terms can be used to describe the same domain. To define the subject matter of psychology from the point of view of its formal establishment as a science and academic discipline (in Leipzig, 1879) is also insufficient because this was done in specific historical circumstances, which narrowed the subject matter to physiologically-related issues. When defining the subject area of a scientific field it is necessary to consider how different ontological and epistemological views have made their influences. A subject area and the approaches by which this subject area has been studied cannot be separated from each other without tracing their mutual historical interactions. The classification of a subject field is theory-laden and thus cannot be neutral or ahistorical. If classification research can claim to have a method that is more general than the study of the concrete developments in the single knowledge fields the key is to be found in the general epistemological theories. It is shown how basic epistemological assumptions have formed the different approaches to psychology during the 20th century. The progress in the understanding of basic philosophical questions is decisive both for the development of a knowledge field and as the point of departure of classification. The theoretical principles developed in this paper are applied in a brief analysis of some concrete classification systems, including the one used by PsycINFO / Psychological Abstracts.

95,014-482-297-957-834,Train Case,"Organizing and providing access to the resources on the Internet has been a problem area in spite of the availability of sophisticated search engines and other software tools. There have been several attempts to organize the resources on the World Wide Web. Some of them have tried to use traditional library classification schemes such as the Library of Congress Classification, the Dewey Decimal Classification and others. However there is a need to assign proper subject headings to them and present them in a logical or hierarchical sequence to cater to the need for browsing. This paper attempts to describe an experimental system designed to organize and provide access to web documents using a faceted pre-coordinate indexing system based on the Deep Structure Indexing System (DSIS) derived from POPSI (Postulate based Permuted Subject Indexing) of Bhattacharyya, and the facet analysis and chain indexing system of Ranganathan. A prototype software system has been designed to create a database of records specifying Web documents according to the Dublin Core and to input a faceted subject heading according to DSIS. Synonymous terms are added to the standard terms in the heading using appropriate symbols. Once the data are entered along with a description and the URL of the web document, the record is stored in the system. More than one faceted subject heading can be assigned to a record depending on the content of the original document. The system stores the surrogates and keeps the faceted subject headings separately after establishing a link. The search is carried out on index entries derived from the faceted subject heading using the chain indexing technique. If a single term is input, the system searches for its presence in the faceted subject headings and displays the subject headings in a sorted sequence reflecting an organizing sequence. If the number of retrieved headings is too large (running into more than a page) the user has the option of entering another search term to be searched in combination. The system searches subject headings already retrieved and looks for those containing the second term. The retrieved faceted subject headings can be displayed and browsed. When the relevant subject heading is selected the system displays the records with their URLs. Using the URL, the original document on the web can be accessed. The prototype system developed in a Windows NT environment using ASP and a web server is under rigorous testing. The database and index management routines need further development.",access resourc internet problem area spite avail sophist search engin softwar tool sever attempt resourc world wide web tri use tradit scheme congress dewey decim other howev assign proper head logic hierarch sequenc cater brows attempt describ experiment system design access web document use facet coordin system deep structur system deriv popsi postul permut bhattacharyya facet analysi chain system ranganathan prototyp softwar system design creat databas record specifi web document accord dublin core input facet head accord synonym ad standard head use appropri symbol data enter along descript url web document record store system facet head assign record depend content origin document system store surrog facet head separ establish link search carri entri deriv facet head use chain techniqu singl input system search presenc facet head display head sort sequenc reflect sequenc number retriev head larg run page option enter anoth search search combin system search head alreadi retriev look contain second retriev facet head display brows relev head select system display record url use url origin document web access prototyp system window environ use web server rigor test databas manag routin

Classificatory activity, however, serves different purposes in different situations. In information retrieval, the primary purpose of classification is to find knowledge that already exists, but one of the purposes of classification in other fields is to discover new knowledge. In this paper, classifications for information retrieval are called professional classifications because they are devised by people who have a professional interest in classification, and classifications for knowledge discovery are called naive classifications because they are devised by people who have no particular interest in studying classification as an end in itself. This paper compares the overall purposes and methods of these two kinds of classifications and provides a general model of the relationships between the two kinds of classificatory activity in the context of information studies. This model addresses issues of the influence of scholarly activity and communication on the creation and revision of classifications for the purposes of information retrieval and for the purposes of knowledge discovery.

99,031-740-156-435-499,Train Case,"This article sets out to investigate genre as a basic criterion in subject indexing of music in libraries and bibliographical databases. The concept of genre is examined in relation to epistemology and to different values and views in both musicology and libraries. The point of departure is to regard music as a domain of actors, institutions and processes. A comprehensive definition of this domain is suggested, which includes several subdomains and discourses. The classical music subdomain and the popular music subdomain are introduced and related to libraries. The article further investigates the concept of paradigm in relation to musicology. It demonstrates how two different paradigms influence the way music is defined, described, classified and indexed and how they are part of a historical context. The fourth part of the article focuses on the concept of genre and the analysis of music and the relation between analytical methods and values/paradigms. In addition, this part focuses on the actors that are responsible for the verbalization of genres in music. The fifth part examines indexing of musical genres with a view to their function as subject access points in databases. The unsatisfactory state of today's practice, as well as the need of a better theoretical foundation of the concept of genre, is documented. The unsatisfactory differentiation in the organising of popular music is exemplified by Danish and Norwegian libraries, including the DK5 system and the Indeksering afmusik guidelines. Finally, arguments are put forward for developing an anthropological paradigm in relation to organizing music in libraries.",articl set investig genr basic criterion music bibliograph databas concept genr examin relat epistemolog valu view musicolog departur regard music domain actor institut process comprehens definit domain suggest sever subdomain discours classic music subdomain popular music subdomain introduc relat articl investig concept paradigm relat musicolog demonstr paradigm influenc music defin describ classifi histor context fourth articl focus concept genr analysi music relat analyt method valu paradigm addit focus actor respons verbal genr music fifth examin music genr view function access databas unsatisfactori state practic better theoret foundat concept genr document unsatisfactori differenti organis popular music exemplifi danish norwegian system indeks afmusik guidelin final argument forward anthropolog paradigm relat music

The purpose of the medium-theory perspective is to trace the historicity of the LIS concept of knowledge organization, that is, an examination of which tradition has produced the concept. The perspective will help to reveal the condition of possibilities of knowledge organization and its strong connection with communication technologies, and their constitution of the social organization of society. The means and modes of communication fundamentally alter existing ways of thinking and of producing, communicating and organizing knowledge. The LIS concept of knowledge organization will be analyzed in relation to the storing and communication of knowledge in oral cultures, written cultures, print culture, and electronic cultures. Through this, it will be argued that the narrow LIS concept of knowledge organization is subordinated and in interaction with a broader social organization of knowledge in society. Further, it will be argued that the rise of the Internet as a source of knowledge and information must be understood in relation to and in continuation of this interaction. Among other things, it will be concluded that a relevant socio-historical background and framework for the LIS concept of knowledge organization is how humans have organized their intellectual activities throughout history in terms of particular means and modes of communication.

The analysis indicates that different socially and historically embedded discourses on art, including pre-paradigmatic studies and scholarly paradigms, pervade knowledge organization in the art institution at three levels, respectively: 1. Art exhibitions, 2. Primary and tertiary document types (printed, audio-visual, and multimedia documents), and 3. Classification systems, bibliographies, and thesauri. The article presents three paradigms in art scholarship (iconographic, stylistic and materialistic) and analyzes in which way, and to what extent, these paradigms are integrated in the taxonomies of the LCC, DDC, UDC, and Soviet BBK classification systems. The paper also addresses the relationship among paradigms, principles for exhibiting works of art, ways of conceptualising and organizing the content in documents on art history, and LIS knowledge organization systems. It is concluded that the UDC, in particular, is well suited for representation of knowledge produced in the contexts of pre-paradigmatic, iconological, and stylistic studies. But documents by the so-called New art scholars drawing on interdisciplinary studies and representing new approaches and paradigms break with the taxonomies on art in the classical hierarchical, universal classification systems.

The history and origin of bibliographic classification [Dewey, Bliss, Mills, Beghtol] are discussed from the perspective of pragmatist philosophy and social studies of science [Kuhn, Merton, Reica]. Choices of structural principles in different schemes are found to rely on more or less implicit philosophical foundations, ranging from rationalism to pragmatism. It is further shown how the increasing application of faceted structures as basic structural principles in universal classification schemes [DDC, UDC] impose rationalistic principles and structures for knowledge organization which are not in alignment with the development of knowledge in the covered disciplines. Further evidence of rationalism in knowledge organization is the fiction/non-fiction distinction, excluding the important role of artistic resources for, in particular, humanistic research. Finally, for the analysis of appropriate bibliographic unit, it is argued that there is a need to shift towards a semiotic approach, founded on an understanding of intertextuality, rather than applying standard principles of hierarchical decomposition of documents.

The most recent edition of DDC, with its enhanced features, has greater potential than other traditional approaches. A review of selected Web sites that use DDC to organize Web resources indicates, however, that the full potential of the DDC scheme for this purpose has not been realized. While the review found that the DDC classification structure was more effective when compared with other knowledge organization systems, we conclude that DDC needs to be further enhanced to make it more suitable for this application. As widely reported in the professional literature, OCLC has conducted research on the potential of DDC for organizing Web resources.

In order to achieve this objective, the user generally does some activities using the IRS. The IRS propose to the user with solutions in response to the queries formulated by the user. The main task of an IRS is to provide the user with solutions that are relevant to his information need. This is termed personalization of information. The main axe of our study is the how to personnalize the system's response according to the user's objective. We propose the use of a user model for personnailizing the system's response. In our approach, the user model defines what to represent for each user. The activities of the user during the use of an IRS is recorded based on the user model. The analysis and synthesis of these activities are used to provide the user with more relevant solutions according to his objective. Three different applications have been developed to validate our approach of personalizing the system?s response and based on an architecture that we defined for a cooperative information retrieval. The three applications are METIORE_STREEMS, METIORE_LORIA and METIORE_REVUES. METIORE_STREEMS is an IRS for managing multimedia information on trees authorized for reforestation by the European Union (EU). The project was sponsored under the EU project LEONARDO.

A critical analysis of classification schemes used in major portals and Web classified directories exposes inconsistencies in the way they classify Internet resources. The inconsistencies indicate that the developers fail to differentiate the various classificatory models, and are unaware of their different rationales. The study establishes eight classificatory models for resources available to Internet users. Internet resources can be classified by subjects, objects, applications, users, locations, reference sources, media, and languages. The first five models are content-related; namely they characterize the content of the resource. The other three models are format-related; namely they characterize the format of the resource or its technological infrastructure.

This distinction has relevance beyond Information Studies, particularly in relation to homosexual concerns. Literary criticism, in particular, frequently addresses the question: when is a work about homosexuality? This paper explores this literary debate and its implications for the design of subject access systems for gay and lesbian communities. By examining the literary criticism of Herman Melville's Billy Budd, particularly in relation to the theories of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick in The Epistemology of the Closet (1990), this paper exposes three tensions that designers of gay and lesbian classifications and vocabularies can expect to face. First is a tension between essentialist and constructivist views of homosexuality, which will affect the choice of terms, categories, and references. Second is a tension between minoritizing and universalizing perspectives on homosexuality. Third is a redefined distinction between aboutness and meaning, in which aboutness refers not to stable document content, but to the system designer's inescapable social and ideological perspectives. Designers of subject access systems can therefore expect to work in a context of intense scrutiny and persistent controversy",research come question theoret distinct about document innat content mean use document distinct relev beyond particularli relat homosexu concern literari critic particular frequent address question homosexu explor literari debat implic design access system gay lesbian commun examin literari critic herman melvil billi budd particularli relat theori eve kosofski sedgwick epistemolog closet 1990 expos tension design gay lesbian vocabulari expect face first tension essentialist constructivist view homosexu affect choic categori refer second tension minorit univers perspect homosexu third redefin distinct about mean about refer stabl document content system design inescap social ideolog perspect design access system therefor expect context intens scrutini persist controversi

Diametrically different opinions, seemingly corroborated through empirical evidence, have been presented since the time of the Cranfield experiments. Similar situations have often been encountered in the history of science if reasoning has exclusively been based on empiricism. In the information scientific field, several empirical laws have been formulated, for example that of the alledgedly inverse precision-recall relationship in information retrieval, of the assumed direct relationship between consistency and quality of indexing, and of the alledged equivalence of automatic with intellectual indexing. Empiricism is seen as only another variation of positivism, which has been abandoned in the natural sciences since the middle of this century for its evident inadequacy, but has latently survived in information science and even now dominates here. Here, it constitutes a source of continual confusion and an impediment to progress. For literally anything an empirical proof can be submitted provided that suitable examples are selected and methods are chosen. Substantial advance in Library and Information Science requires abandoning empiricism.

In the information retrieval domain, the work as opposed to the document, has only recently received focused attention. In this paper, the definition of the work as an entity for information retrieval is examined. A taxonomic definition (that is, a definition built around a taxonomy) is presented. An epistemological perspective aids in understanding the components of the taxonomic definition. Works, thus defined as entities for information retrieval, are seen to constitute sets of varying instantiations of abstract creations.

The Genre and Activity of the Experimental Article in Science is written knowledge as it is produced by the academy. Bazerman discusses in particular the rhetoric, communicative, and epistemological issues of written knowledge. The article discusses these themes in a library and information science (LIS) perspective in terms of their implications for LIS research. For several reasons, it is argued that this way of scrutinizing into written knowledge ought to be of special interest to LIS research. As an example of a particular field of research in LIS, the article discusses the relationship between indexing theory and written knowledge. Bazerman analyzes written knowledge from a literary point of view. Among other things, it is argued that indexing theory can be seen as part of literary theory in that some of the questions raised by the latter are also raised in indexing theory. Furthermore, it is put forward that the indexer can be considered an author. The indexer produces a text, the document representation, which is the text the user actually meets in the first place. That way, the producer of a document representation is to some extent responsible for the quality of the documents indexed. Having discussed this relationship between written knowledge and LIS research in general and indexing theory in particular, it is concluded that LIS research ought to head toward more humanistic oriented research traditions, if the line of research presented by Bazerman should be considered useful for LIS.",gener concern bazerman book shape written genr activ experiment articl written produc academi bazerman discuss particular rhetor commun epistemolog issu written articl discuss theme perspect implic research sever reason argu scrutin written ought special interest research exampl particular research articl discuss relationship theori written bazerman analyz written literari view among thing argu theori seen literari theori question rais latter rais theori furthermor forward consid produc text document represent text actual meet first place produc document represent extent respons qualiti document discuss relationship written research gener theori particular conclud research ought head toward humanist orient research tradit line research bazerman consid use

This holds true in particular in the case of general concepts and of their syntactical connectivity. Hence, natural language query phrasing and searching is an unending adventure of trial and error and, in most cases, has an unsatisfactory outcome with respect to the recall and precision ratios of the responses. Human indexing is based on knowledgeable document interpretation and aims - among other things - at introducing predictability into the representation of documents. Due to the indeterminacy of natural language text phrasing and image construction, any adequate indexing is also indeterminate in nature and therefore inherently defies any satisfactory algorithmization. But human indexing suffers from a different set of deficiencies which are absent in the processing of non-interpreted natural language. An optimally effective information system combines both types of language in such a manner that their specific strengths are preserved and their weaknesses are avoided. If the goal is a large and enduring information system for more than merely known-item searches, the expenditure for an advanced index language and its knowledgeable and careful employment is unavoidable.",natur text phrase indetermin process inher lack represent predict hold true particular case gener concept syntact connect henc natur languag queri phrase search unend adventur trial error case unsatisfactori outcom respect recal precis ratio respons human document interpret aim among thing introduc predict represent document due indeterminaci natur languag text phrase imag construct adequ indetermin natur therefor inher defi satisfactori algorithm human suffer defici absent process interpret natur languag optim effect system combin type languag manner specif strength preserv weak avoid goal larg endur system mere known item search expenditur advanc languag care employ unavoid

The best efforts to achieve an arrangement char is helpful to users will be thwarted by the multifaceted nature of these items and the specific needs of the user and the library. Items on a particular subject will be scattered throughout the library building(s) across disciplines, by physical form, by frequency of use and whether and for how long they may be borrowed. Even though the rich information content of multifaceted items may be represented in the notation, the items required by a user will be scattered across library shelves when the item is placed in a single relative location. This paper explores these issues using examples from a University Library classified using the Dea ey Decimal Classification Scheme (DDC). The electronic context of the library OPAC can transcend the constraints imposed by the predominantly physical nature of library collections, yet the current use of classification schemes in on-line systems retains many of these limitations. Examples of such systems applying DDC on the World Wide Web are discussed and compared with a system that seeks to use DDC in what is called view-based searching. The interface and the resulting browsing and searching capability of a View-Based Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) are described.

A key challenge in work centered design of classification schemes is the evolving semantics of work. This article introduces a work centered approach to the design of classification schemes, based on the framework of cognitive work analysis. We launch collaborative task situations as a new unit of analysis for capturing evolving semantic structures in work domains. An example case from a cognitive work analysis of three national film research archives illustrates the application of the framework for identifying actors' needs for a classification scheme to support collaborative knowledge integration. It is concluded that a main contribution of the new approach is support for empirical analysis and overall design of classification schemes that can serve as material interfaces for actors' negotiations and integration of knowledge perspectives during collaborative work.",center design scheme emerg area research pose particular challeng domain analysi scheme construct key challeng center design scheme evolv semant articl introduc center design scheme framework cognit analysi launch collabor task situat new unit analysi captur evolv semant structur domain exampl case cognit analysi nation film research archiv illustr applic framework identifi actor scheme support collabor integr conclud main contribut new support empir analysi overal design scheme serv materi interfac actor negoti integr perspect collabor

On the one part, the relevance of a response concerns its exactness compared with the user's query, On the other part, it concerns its correspondence with the user's knowledge level and his preferences. One of the major contributions in this area of personalization of the system's response is by taking into consideration each user's specificity. We propose the use of explicit user model where the system's solution will be determined by the knowledge of the user. The user's activities are recorded as documents. The method we adopt for information retrieval combines query by criteria and information analysis. We have also proposed architecture for cooperative information retrieval. This architecture allows two users to share their experience in the process information retrieval and for the interpretation of the system's result, on distant machines. The proposals were implemented in two systems: STREEMS and METIORE.

144,193-381-516-111-686,Train Case,"In a scientific and technological watch (STW) task, an expert user needs to survey the evolution of research topics in his area of specialization in order to detect interesting changes. The majority of methods proposing evaluation metrics (bibliometrics and scientometrics studies) for STW rely solely on statistical data analysis methods (co-citation analysis, co-word analysis). Such methods usually work on structured databases where the units of analysis (words, keywords) are already attributed to documents by human indexers. The advent of huge amounts of unstructured textual data has rendered necessary the integration of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to first extract meaningful units from texts. We propose a method for STW which is NLP-oriented. The method not only analyses texts linguistically in order to extract terms from them, but also uses linguistic relations (syntactic variations) as the basis for clustering. Terms and variation relations are formalised as weighted di-graphs which the clustering algorithm, CPCL (Classification by Preferential Clustered Link) will seek to reduce in order to produce classes. These classes ideally represent the research topics present in the corpus. The results of the classification are subjected to validation by an expert in STW.",scientif technolog watch task expert survey evolut research topic area special order detect interest chang major method propos evalu metric bibliometr scientometr reli sole statist data analysi method citat analysi word analysi method usual structur databas unit analysi word keyword alreadi attribut document human advent huge amount unstructur textual data render necessari integr natur languag process nlp techniqu first extract meaning unit text propos method nlp orient method analys text linguist order extract use linguist relat syntact variat basi cluster variat relat formalis weight graph cluster algorithm preferenti cluster link seek reduc order produc class class ideal repres research topic corpu result valid expert
145,194-391-518-246-985,Train Case,"This article is organized in 10 sections: (1) Knowledge Organization (KO) is a wide interdisciplinary field, much broader than Library and Information Science (LIS). (2) Inside LIS there have been many different approaches and traditions of KO with little mutual influence. These traditions have to a large extent been defined by new technology, for which reason the theoretical integration and underpinning has not been well considered. The most important technology-driven traditions are: a) Manual indexing and classification in libraries and reference works, b) Documentation and scientific communication, c) Information storage and retrieval by computers, d) Citation based KO and e) Full text, hypertext and Internet based approaches. These traditions taken together define very much the special LIS focus on KO. For KO as a field of research it is important to establish a fruitful theoretical frame of reference for this overall field. This paper provides some suggestions. (3) One important, theoretical distinction to consider is the one between social and intellectual forms of KO. Social forms of KO are related to professional training, disciplines and social groups while intellectual organization is related to concepts and theories in the fields to be organized. (4) The social perspective includes in addition the systems of genres and documents as well as the social system of knowledge producers, knowledge intermediaries and knowledge users. (5) This social system of documents, genres and agents makes available a very complicated structure of potential subject access points (SAPs), which may be used in information retrieval (IR). The basic aim of research in KO is to develop knowledge on how to optimise this system of SAPs and its utilization in IR. (6) SAPs may be seen as signs, and their production and use may be understood from a social semiotic point of view. (7) The concept of paradigms is also helpful because different groups and interests tend to be organized according to a paradigm and to develop different criteria of relevance, and thus different criteria of likeliness in KO. (8) The basic unit in KO is the semantic relation between two concepts, and such relations are embedded in theories. (9) In classification like things are grouped together, but what is considered similar is not a trivial question. (10) The paper concludes with the considering of methods for KO. Basically the methods of any field are connected with epistemological theories. This is also the case with KO. The existing methods as described in the literature of KO fit into a classification of basic epistemological views. The debate about the methods of KO at the deepest level therefore implies an epistemological discussion.",articl section wide interdisciplinari much broader insid mani tradit littl mutual influenc tradit larg extent defin new technolog reason theoret integr underpin consid import technolog driven tradit manual refer document scientif commun storag retriev comput citat full text hypertext internet tradit taken togeth defin much special focu research import establish fruit theoret frame refer overal suggest import theoret distinct consid social intellectu form social form relat profession train disciplin social group intellectu relat concept theori social perspect addit system genr document social system produc intermediari social system document genr agent make avail complic structur potenti access sap use retriev basic aim research optimis system sap util sap seen sign product use understood social semiot view concept paradigm help group interest tend accord paradigm criteria relev criteria likeli basic unit semant relat concept relat embed theori like thing group togeth consid similar trivial question conclud consid method basic method connect epistemolog theori case exist method describ literatur fit basic epistemolog view debat method deepest level therefor impli epistemolog discuss

An author number also brings together all the books by one author in one specific subject. A chronological book number will clearly portray the development of a subject over a given period. Book numbers are indispensable for a shelflist. The National Library (NL) of India at Kolkata has a collection of about 3 million documents. For organizing its contents it uses the DDC and the shelf arrangement is by Cutter's three figure author table. For Indian names it uses its home-made author table described here. Though the National Library table is designed especially for Indian names across all religions and regional cultures, yet its use outside the National Library has not been reported mostly due lack of marketing.

How this is done in practice and the patterns to be found are the focus of this article. The empirical basis is the collection of 76,601 different keywords with a total frequency of 178,215 from 500 randomly chosen taggers on del.icio.us. at the end of 2005. The keywords collected were then analyzed quantitatively statistically by uncovering their frequency and percentage distribution and through a statistical correspondence analysis in order to uncover possible patterns in the users' tags. Subsequently, a qualitative textual analysis of the tags was made in order to find out by analysis which tagging strategies are represented in the data material. This led to four conclusions. 1) the distribution of keywords follows classic power law; 2) distinct tagging communities are identifiable; 3) the most frequently used tags are situated on a general-specific axis; and 4) nine distinct tagging strategies are observed.

The authors analyze three weblogs (Biblioatipici, Letture and Andrea Marchitelli’s blog) to demonstrate that different contents may be classified using the appropriate scheme.; Biblioatipici is a weblog about temporary workers in libraries and Italian documentation centres, indexed with a faceted scheme, home made by authors. Letture, a diary about reading and books, is indexed by DDC; finally, Andrea Marchitelli’s blog, a weblog about digital libraries and open access, is indexed by JITA, the scheme used for indexing e-prints in some different open archives.; The three applications are presented starting from the most complex scheme (i.e. the faceted one) to the simple but least functional (JITA), passing through a traditional bibliographic classification scheme, the Dewey Decimal Classification.; The analysis demonstrates that different web contents can efficiently be classified with different schemes. In particular, with the facets one (Biblioatipici) the indexer is able to generate the needed classes in the indexing phase. Moreover with a small number of facets and foci one can obtain an exponential number of classes. Finally, one of the advantages for the user is that the faceted scheme allows multiple accesses on the basis of different information requirements, in addition to being coherent and intuitive. DDC scheme can be more suitable than the first web pages or blogs performing a sort of digital library. In this case in fact the DDC scheme constitutes a consolidated classification standard, widespread in a huge quantity of libraries and the use of a different scheme might get confusion. JITA scheme, finally, can find a huge applicability in web pages (or blogs) in LIS field showing several advantages: it’s very simple and essentialy pragmatic, intuitive and coherent.

The following question is considered: Could Repertory Grid technique be used as a tool in the creation of metadata? It is postulated that repertory grid technique may be used as a tool for creating metadata labels, or tags, where the labels or tags describe entities, which may be images, documents or expressions. Repertory grid technique can provide a method for examining the detail about an individual's mental models, or personal construct systems of lifeworld entities, which may include images, documents or expressions. The question were considered by looking at the results of an earlier study, which explored the personal constructs of systems analysts using the repertory grid technique to examine the mental conceptualizations that determine the extent of difference in conceptualization. Categorical core areas of expressions used during software requirements development emerge through classification of the conceptualizations of expressions elicited via the repertory grid interviews. Repertory grid also reveals, through cluster analysis, the subtle difference in the way each participant conceptually related one expression to another expression.

Determining the extent to which such an objective is achieved is the focus of what is known as a knowledge audit. In this practice-oriented article, the authors review the fundamentals of creating a taxonomy, the use of meta-data in a necessary process known as classification and the role of expertise locators where the knowledge is not explicit but resides within experts in the form of tacit knowledge.

The latter include eliminating ambiguity, controlling synonyms or equivalents, establishing explicit semantic relationships such as hierarchical and associative relationships, and presenting both relationships and properties of concepts in the knowledge models. Examples of KOS include lists, authority files, gazetteers, synonym rings, taxonomies and classification schemes, thesauri, and ontologies. These systems model the underlying semantic structure of a domain and provide semantics, navigation, and translation through labels, definitions, typing, relationships, and properties for concepts. The term knowledge organization systems (KOS) is intended to encompass all types of schemes for organizing information and promoting knowledge management, such as classification schemes, gazetteers, lexical databases, taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies (Hodge 2000). These systems model the underlying semantic structure of a domain and provide semantics, navigation, and translation through labels, definitions, typing, relationships, and properties for concepts (Hill et al. 2002, Koch and Tudhope 2004).

Quality SGs have evolved and the role of classification has changed accordingly from supporting subject organization on the interface and automatic categorization of resources, towards supporting a semantic linking, control and vocabulary mapping between different indexing systems in subject hubs and federated SGs. In this period, many SGs ceased to exist and little information remains available regarding their status. SGs currently using UDC, for some part of their resource organization, do not use a UDC subject hierarchy at the interface and its role in resource indexing has become more difficult to observe.

It consists of different kinds of semantic relationships, with the aim of guiding users to the choice of the most suitable index and search terms for expressing a certain concept. The relational semantics of a thesaurus deal with methods to connect terms with related meanings and are intended to enhance information recall capabilities. In this paper, focused on hierarchical relations, different aspects of the relational semantics of thesauri, and among them the possibility of developing richer structures, are analyzed. Thesauri are viewed as semantic tools providing, for operational purposes, the representation of the meaning of the terms. The paper stresses how theories of semantics, holding different perspectives about the nature of meaning and how it is represented, affect the design of the relational semantics of thesauri. The need for tools capable of representing the complexity of knowledge and of the semantics of terms as it occurs in the literature of their respective subject fields is advocated.

We briefly introduce the beginning and principles of folksonomy and discuss the categorizing concept of folksonomies on the basis of the computer program delicious. The selection of the metadata tagged is not accidental, rather tagging follows a pattern that proves to be the pattern for the classic power law, which, in many complex systems is seen to unfold as an imitation-dynamic that creates an asymmetry, where a few descriptive metadata are often reproduced and the majority seldom reproduced. In del.icio.us, it is the very broadband basic subject headings that are often reproduced and achieve power in the system - which in cognitive psychology is called cognitive basic categories - while the small, more specific subject headings are seldom reproduced. The law of power's underlying imitation-dynamic in del.icio.us is explained from the perspective of different theoretical paradigms, i.e. network, economy and cognition. The theorectical and speculative conclusion is that the law of power and asymmetry is biased by a cognitive economizing through a simplification principle in the users' construction of descriptive metadata. Free tagging in folksonomies is comparable to empirical experiments in free categorization. Users often choose broad basic categories, because that requires the least cognitive effort. The consequences are that folksonomy is not necessarily a better, more realistic and cheaper method of creating metadata than that which can be generated through taxonomies, faceted classification or search algorithms.

While the design and construction of controlled vo-cabularies have been prescribed at the technical level in great detail over the past decades, the methodological level has been somewhat neglected. However, classification research has in recent years focused on developing approaches to the analysis of users, domains, and activities that could produce requirements for the design of controlled vocabularies. Researchers have of-ten argued that the design, construction, and use of controlled vocabularies need to be based on analyses and understandings of the contexts in which these controlled vocabularies function. While one would assume that the growing body of research on human information behavior might help guide the development of controlled vocabularies shed light on these contexts, unfor-tunately, much of the research in this area is descriptive in nature and of little use for systems design. This paper discusses these trends and outlines a holistic approach that demonstrates how the design of controlled vocabularies can be informed by inves-tigations of people’s interactions with information. This approach is based on the Cognitive Work Analysis framework and outlines several dimensions of human-information interactions. Application of this approach will result is a comprehensive un-derstanding of the contexts in which the controlled vocabulary will function and which can be used for the development of for the development of controlled vocabularies.",abstract scheme thesauri taxonomi control vocabulari play import role ganiz retriev mani environ design construct control cabulari prescrib technic level great detail past decad methodolog level somewhat neglect howev research recent year focus analysi domain activ could produc requir design control vocabulari research argu design construct use control vocabulari analys understand context control vocabulari function assum grow bodi research human behavior might help guid control vocabulari shed light context unfor tunat much research area descript natur littl use system design discuss trend outlin holist demonstr design control vocabulari tigat peopl interact cognit analysi framework outlin sever dimens human interact applic result comprehens derstand context control vocabulari function use control vocabulari

Its findings can be relevant to knowledge organization, and models of knowledge can, in turn, offer relevant ontological suggestions. Several philosophers in time have pointed out that reality is structured into a series of integrative levels, like the physical, the biological, the mental, and the cultural, and that each level plays as a base for the emergence of more complex levels. More detailed theories of levels have been developed by Nicolai Hartmann and James K. Feibleman, and these have been considered as a source for structuring principles in bibliographic classification by both the Classification Research Group (CRG) and Ingetraut Dahlberg. CRG's analysis of levels and of their possible application to a new general classification scheme based on phenomena instead of disciplines, as it was formulated by Derek Austin in 1969, is examined in detail.

Therefore, a definition of the concept of Representation of knowledge is indispensable. The term representation has been used in western cultural and intellectual tradition to refer to the diverse ways that a subject comprehends an object. Representation is a process which requires the structure of natural language and human memory whereby it is interwoven in a subject and in conscience. However, at the present time, the term Representation of knowledge is applied to the processing of electronic information, combined with the aim of emulating the human mind in such a way that one has endeavoured to transfer, with great difficulty, the complex structurality of the conceptual representation of human knowledge to new digital information technologies. Thus, nowadays, representation of knowledge has taken on diverse meanings and it has focussed, for the moment, on certain structures and conceptual hierarchies which carry and transfer information, and has initially been based on the current representation of knowledge using artificial intelligence. The traditional languages of documentation, also referred to as languages of representation, offer a structured representation of conceptual fields, symbols and terms of natural and notational language, and they are the pillars for the necessary correspondence between the object or text and its representation. These correspondences, connections and symbolisations will be established within the electronic framework by means of different models and of the goal domain, which will give rise to organisations, structures, maps, networks and levels, as new electronic documents are not compact units but segments of information. Thus, the new representation of knowledge refers to data, images, figures and symbolised, treated, processed and structured ideas which replace or refer to documents within the framework of technical processing and the recuperation of electronic information.",new represent appli framework electron segment comprehens new materi support review total conceptualis terminolog appli entail review tradit documentari practic therefor definit concept represent indispens represent use western cultur intellectu tradit refer divers comprehend object represent process requir structur natur languag human memori wherebi interwoven conscienc howev time represent appli process electron combin aim emul human mind endeavour transfer great difficulti complex structur conceptu represent human new digit technolog nowaday represent taken divers mean focuss moment certain structur conceptu hierarchi carri transfer initi current represent use artifici intellig tradit languag document refer languag represent offer structur represent conceptu symbol natur notat languag pillar necessari correspond object text represent correspond connect symbolis establish electron framework mean model goal domain give rise organis structur map network level new electron document compact unit segment new represent refer data imag figur symbolis treat process structur idea replac refer document framework technic process recuper electron

With open source, copyleft licensing eliminates copyright acquisition and protection as major production processes, suggesting that the open source software industry warrants a separate NAICS category.

He has published papers on this subject in several international journals and conference pro- ceedings. He is member of the scientific advisory boards of the Universal Decimal Classification Con- sortium (UDCC) and of the journal Knowledge Organization, and vice-president of the International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO). Gnoli, Claudio. Classification Transcends Library Business. Knowledge Organization, 37(3), 223-229. 26 references. Abstract: Although bibliographic classifications usually adopt a perspective different from that of object classifications, the two have obvious relationships. These become especially relevant when users are looking for knowledge scattered in a wide va- riety of forms and media. This is an increasingly common situation, as library catalogues now coexist in the global digital envi- ronment with catalogues of archives, of museums, of commercial products, and many other information resources. In order to make the subject content of all these resources searchable, a broader conception of classification is needed, that can be applied to any knowledge item, rather than only bibliographic materials. To illustrate this we take an example of the research on bag- pipes in Northern Italian folklore. For this kind of research, the most effective search strategy is a cross-media one, looking for many different knowledge sources such as published documents, police archives, painting details, museum specimens, organi- zations devoted to related subjects. To provide satisfying results for this kind of search, the traditional disciplinary approach to classification is not sufficient.

216,031-650-207-787-672,Train Case,"In the last two decades of knowledge organization (KO) research, there has been an increasing interest in the context-dependent nature of human knowledge. Contextualism maintains that knowledge is not available in a neutral and objective way, but is always interwoven with the process of knowledge production and the prerequisites of the knower. As a first step towards a systematic organization of epistemic contexts, the concept of knowledge will be considered in its onto- logical (WHAT) and epistemological (WHO) including methodological (HOW) dimensions. In current KO research, however, either the contextualism is not fully implemented (classification-as-ontology) or the ambition for a context-transcending universal KOS seems to have been abandoned (classification-as-epistemology). Based on a combined ontology and epistemology it will be argued that a phenom- ena-based approach to KO as stipulated by the Leon Manifesto, for example, requires a revision of the underlying phenomenon concept as a relation between the known object (WHAT) and the knowing subject (WHO), which is constituted by the application of specific meth- ods (HOW). While traditional subject indexing of documents often relies on the organizing principle ""levels of being"" (WHAT), for a fu- ture context indexing, two novel principles are proposed, namely ""levels of knowing"" (WHO) and ""integral methodological pluralism"" (HOW).",last decad research increas interest context depend natur human contextu maintain avail neutral object alway interwoven process product prerequisit knower first step toward systemat epistem context concept consid onto logic epistemolog methodolog dimens current research howev either contextu fulli implement ontolog ambit context transcend univers seem abandon epistemolog combin ontolog epistemolog argu phenom stipul leon manifesto exampl requir revis underli phenomenon concept relat known object know constitut applic specif meth tradit document often reli principl level ture context novel principl propos name level know integr methodolog plural

Folksonomies consisting of subject designators (tags) assigned by users, however, have one important drawback: they do not express semantic relationships either hierarchical or associative between tags. As a consequence, the use of tags to browse information resources requires moving from one resource to another, based on coincidence and not on the pre-established meaningful or logical connections that may exist between related resources. We suggest that the semantic structure of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) may be used in complementing and supporting tag-based browsing. In this work, two specific questions were investigated: (1) Are terms used as tags in folksonomies included in the UDC? and (2) Which facets of UDC match the characteristics of documents or information objects that are tagged in folksonomies? A collection of the most popular tags from Amazon, LibraryThing, Delicious and 43Things was investigated. The universal nature of UDC was examined through the universality of topics and facets covering diverse human interests which are at the same time interconnected and form a rich and intricate semantic structure.

Gnoli, Claudio. Metadata About What? Distinguishing Between Ontic, Epistemic, and Documental Dimensions in Knowledge Organization. Knowledge Organization. 39(4), 268-275. 37 references. ABSTRACT: The spread of many new media and formats is changing the scenario faced by knowledge organizers: as printed monographs are not the only standard form of knowledge carrier anymore, the traditional kind of knowl- edge organization (KO) systems based on academic disciplines is put into question. A sounder foundation can be provided by an analysis of the different dimensions concurring to form the content of any knowledge item—what Brian Vickery described as the steps ""from the world to the classifier."" The ultimate referents of documents are the phenomena of the real world, that can be ordered by ontology, the study of what exists. Phenomena coexist in subjects with the perspectives by which they are considered, pertaining to epistemology, and with the formal features of knowledge carriers, adding a further, pragmatic layer. All these di- mensions can be accounted for in metadata, but are often done so in mixed ways, making indexes less rigorous and interoperable. For example, while facet analysis was originally developed for subject indexing, many ""faceted"" interfaces today mix subject fac- ets with form facets, and schemes presented as ""ontologies"" for the ""semantic Web"" also code for non-semantic information. In bibliographic classifications, phenomena are often confused with the disciplines dealing with them, the latter being assumed to be the most useful starting point, for users will have either one or another perspective. A general citation order of dimensions— phenomena, perspective, carrier—is recommended, helping to concentrate most relevant information at the beginning of head- ings.",claudio gnoli academ librarian sinc 1994 main interest theori publish sever intern journal confer ceed member scientif advisori board univers decim con sortium udcc journal vice presid intern societi isko gnoli claudio metadata distinguish ontic epistem document dimens refer abstract spread mani new media format chang scenario face print monograph standard form carrier anymor tradit kind knowl edg system academ disciplin question sounder foundat analysi dimens concur form content item brian vickeri describ step world classifi ultim refer document phenomena world order ontolog exist phenomena coexist perspect consid pertain epistemolog formal featur carrier ad pragmat layer mension account metadata often done mix make less rigor interoper exampl facet analysi origin mani facet interfac mix form facet scheme ontolog semant web code semant bibliograph phenomena often confus disciplin deal latter assum use start either anoth perspect gener citat order dimens phenomena perspect carrier recommend help concentr relev begin head ing

The model of scale-free networks, which has been recently developed and widely applied since, can be effectively used in terminology research as well. Operation based on the principle of networks is a universal characteristic of complex systems. Networks are governed by general laws. The model of scale-free networks can be viewed as a statistical-probability model, and it can be described with mathematical tools. Its main feature is that ‘everything is connected to everything else’, that is every node is reachable (in a few steps) starting from any other node; this phenomena called ‘the small world phenomenon’. The existence of a linguistic network and the general laws of the operation of networks enable us to place issues of language use in the complex system of relations that reveal the deeper connections between phenomena with the help of networks embedded in each other.

This paper proposes an approach forhandling domain relevant terms from Arabic non-diacriticised semi-structured corpora. In input, the structure of documentsis exploited to organize knowledge in a contextual graph, which is exploitedto extract relevant terms. This network contains simple and compound nouns handled by a morphosyntactic shallow parser. The noun phrases are evaluated in terms of termhood and unithood by ; means of possibilistic measures. We apply a qualitative approach, which weighs terms according to their positions in the structure of the document. In output, the extracted knowledge is organized as network modeling dependencies between terms, which can be exploited to infer semantic relations.We test our approach on three specific domain corpora. The goal of this evaluation is to check if our model for organizing and exploiting contextual knowledge will improve the accuracy of extraction of simple and compound nouns. We also investigate the role of compound nouns in improving information retrieval results.",ontolog import role retriev domain ontolog compos concept repres domain relev exist ontolog construct make use statist linguist extract domain relev qualiti quantiti influenc accuraci terminologyextract step extract retriev propos forhandl domain relev arab diacriticis semi structur corpora input structur documentsi exploit contextu graph exploitedto extract relev network contain simpl compound noun handl morphosyntact shallow parser noun phrase evalu termhood unithood mean possibilist measur appli qualit weigh accord posit structur document output extract network model depend exploit infer semant relat test specif domain corpora goal evalu check model exploit contextu improv accuraci extract simpl compound noun investig role compound noun improv retriev result

244,103-364-820-610-122,Train Case,"Any ontological theory commits us to accept and classify a number of phenomena in a more or less specific way – and vice versa: a classification tends to reveal the theoretical outlook of its creator. Objects and their descriptions and relations are not just “given” but determined by theories. Knowledge is fallible and consensus is rare. By implication, knowledge organization has to consider different theories/views and their foundations. Bibliographical classifications depend on subject knowledge and on the same theories as corresponding scientific and scholarly classifications. Some classifications are based on logical distinctions, others on empirical examinations, and some on mappings of common ancestors or on establishing functional criteria. To evaluate a classification is to involve oneself in the research which has produced the given classification. Because research is always based more or less on specific epistemological ideals (e.g. empiricism, rationalism, historicism or pragmatism), the evaluation of classification includes the evaluation of the epistemological foundations of the research on which given classifications have been based. The field of knowledge organization itself is based on different approaches and traditions such as user-based and cognitive views, facet-analytical views, numeric taxonomic approaches, bibliometrics and domain-analytic approaches. These approaches and traditions are again connected to epistemological views, which have to be considered. Only the domain-analytic view is fully committed to exploring knowledge organization in the light of subject knowledge and substantial scholarly theories.",ontolog theori commit accept classifi number phenomena less specif vice versa tend reveal theoret outlook creator object descript relat given determin theori fallibl consensu rare implic consid theori view foundat bibliograph depend theori correspond scientif scholarli logic distinct other empir examin map common ancestor establish function criteria evalu involv oneself research produc given research alway less specif epistemolog ideal empiric ration historic pragmat evalu evalu epistemolog foundat research given tradit cognit view facet analyt view numer taxonom bibliometr domain analyt tradit connect epistemolog view consid domain analyt view fulli commit explor light substanti scholarli theori

246,105-100-051-441-427,Train Case,"The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate that the mechanisms of power around classifications of gender and sexuality are not always top-down or bottom-up. Instead, the weight of social discipline among members of sexual subcultures themselves helps to create these classifications, often reflecting the nomenclature of subjects and desires within sexual subcultures in a complex relationship to a dominant culture. Critically examining two benchmarks in the development of sexual nomenclature within queer subcultures, this paper finds its evidence in George Chauncey's little known analysis (1985) of a navy investigation of male homosexuality at the Newport Naval Training Station during the World War I era and in contemporary folksonomic classifi- cations of representations of queer desire within Xtube, a database of online pornography. Social discipline within these sexual sub- cultures occurs in the stabilization of nomenclature through socialization and through members' overt intervention into each oth- ers' self-understanding. Both the Newport and Xtube evidence also reveals a complex social and cultural structure among members of sexual subcultures by drawing our attention to the particularity of various modes of sexual being and the relationship between those modes and particular configurations of sexual identity. In the process, this paper allows us to reassess, first, a presupposition of folksonomies as free of discipline allowing for their emancipatory potential and, second, the prevailing binary understandings of authority in the development of sexual nomenclatures and classifications as either top-down or bottom-up.",purpos essay demonstr mechan power around gender sexual alway bottom instead weight social disciplin among member sexual subcultur help creat often reflect nomenclatur desir sexual subcultur complex relationship domin cultur critic examin benchmark sexual nomenclatur queer subcultur find evid georg chauncey littl known analysi 1985 navi investig male homosexu newport naval train station world war era contemporari folksonom classifi cation represent queer desir xtube databas onlin pornographi social disciplin sexual cultur occur stabil nomenclatur social member overt intervent self understand newport xtube evid reveal complex social cultur structur among member sexual subcultur draw attent particular variou mode sexual relationship mode particular configur sexual ident process allow reassess first presupposit folksonomi free disciplin allow emancipatori potenti second prevail binari understand sexual nomenclatur either bottom

A more collaborative approach would entail a change in the role of professionals and in the goals and values of the systems. This paper explores the notion of authority and the role of professionals in a changing environment where more people participate in the organization and repre- sentation of information and knowledge. The paper questions the traditional role of the professionals and argues that systems must be designed to facilitate trust and authority, and that the authority of folksonomies and systems comes from the users' collective interpretations and meaning production.",jen erik mai associ professor faculti univers toronto previous serv vice dean act dean research interest lie broad area represent current scholarship question conceptu foundat seek establish epistemolog foundat accept raliti interpret across commun publish conceptu methodolog sue represent semiot theoret framework theori domain analysi cognit analysi recent public explor trust mai jen erik folksonomi new order digit disord refer abstract represent histor done profe sional rise social media spread notion done collabor collabor entail chang role profession goal valu system explor notion role profession chang environ peopl particip repr sentat question tradit role profession argu system must design facilit trust folksonomi system come collect interpret mean product

Biology has really become an information science; and, as such, it is also inspiring new ways of thinking and new kinds of knowledge paradigms beyond those discussed during past decades. In this regard, a new ""bioinformational"" approach to the inter-multi-disciplinary relationships among the sciences will be proposed herein: scientomics. Biologically inspired, scientomics contemplates the multifarious interactions between scientific disciplines from the ""knowledge recombination"" vantage point. In their historical expansion, the sciences would have recapitulated upon collective cognitive dynamics already realized along the evolutionary expansion of living systems, mostly by means of domain recombination processes within cellular genomes, but also occurring neurally inside the ""cerebral workspace"" of human brains and advanced mammals. Scientomics, understood as a new research field in the domain of knowledge organization, would capture the ongoing processes of scientific expansion and recombination by means of genomic inspired software (like in the new field of culturomics). It would explain the peculiar interaction maps of the sciences (scientometrics) as well as the increasing complexity of research amidst scientific and technological cumulative achievements. Beyond the polarized classical positions of reductionism and holism, scientomics could also propose new conceptual tools for scientific integration and planning, and for research management.",import conceptu chang time biolog definit abandon mechanist hardcor advanc fast furiou along dimens biolog realli becom inspir new think new kind paradigm beyond discuss past decad regard new bioinform inter multi disciplinari relationship among propos herein scientom biolog inspir scientom contempl multifari interact scientif disciplin recombin vantag histor expans recapitul upon collect cognit dynam alreadi realiz along evolutionari expans live system mostli mean domain recombin process cellular genom occur neural insid cerebr workspac human brain advanc mammal scientom understood new research domain captur ongo process scientif expans recombin mean genom inspir softwar like new culturom explain peculiar interact map scientometr increas complex research amidst scientif technolog cumul achiev beyond polar classic posit reduction holism scientom could propos new conceptu tool scientif integr plan research manag

Many compound classes have been removed from the main tables, and more radical revisions of classes (particularly those for Medicine and Religion) have introduced a rigorous analysis, a clearer sense of citation order, and building of compound classes according to a more logical system syntax. The faceted approach provides a means of formalizing the relationships in the classification and making them explicit for machine recognition. In the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (BC2) (which has been a source for both UDC classes mentioned above), terminologies are encoded for automatic generation of hierarchical and associative relationships. Nevertheless, difficulties are encountered in vocabulary control, and a similar phenomenon is observed in UDC. Current work has revealed differences in the vocabulary of humanities and science, notably the way in which terms in the humanities should be handled when these are semantically complex.

We confront the current debates within the KO community about the relevance of universal bibliographic classifications and the thesaurus in the web with the ongoing discussions about the epistemological and methodological assumptions underlying data-driven inquiry. In essence, Big Data will not remove the need for humanly-constructed KOSs. However, ongoing transformations in knowledge production processes entailed by Big Data and web 2.0 put pressure on the KO community to rethink the standpoint from which KOSs are designed. Essentially, the field of KO needs to move from laying down the apodictic (that which we know for all time) to adapting to the new world of social and natural scientific knowledge by creating maximally flexible schemas – faceted rather than Aristotelean classifications. KO also needs to adapt to the changing nature of output in the social and natural sciences, to the extent that these in turn are being affected by the advent of Big Data. Theoretically, this entails a shift from purely universalist and normative top-down approaches to more descriptive bottom-up approaches that can be inclusive of diverse viewpoints. Methodologically, this means striking the right balance between two seemingly opposing modalities in designing KOSs: the necessity on the one hand to incorporate automated techniques and on the other, to solicit contributions from amateurs (crowdsourcing) via Web 2.0 platforms.",propos high level analysi implic big data organis organis system koss confront current debat commun relev univers bibliograph thesauru web ongo discuss epistemolog methodolog assumpt underli data driven inquiri essenc big data remov humanli construct koss howev ongo transform product process entail big data web pressur commun rethink standpoint koss design essenti move lay apodict know time adapt new world social natur scientif creat maxim flexibl schema facet rather aristotelean adapt chang natur output social natur extent turn affect advent big data theoret entail shift pure universalist norm descript bottom inclus divers viewpoint methodolog mean strike right balanc seemingli oppos modal design koss necess hand incorpor autom techniqu solicit contribut amateur crowdsourc via web platform

Relying on professional keyword assignment is not a practical option for large image collections due to resource constraints. Although a number of content-based image retrieval systems have been launched, they have not demonstrated sufficient utility on large-scale image sources on the web, and are usually used as a supplement to existing text-based image retrieval systems. An alternative to professional image indexing can be social tagging -- with two major types being photo-sharing networks and image labeling games. Here we analyze these applications to evaluate their usefulness from the semantic point of view. We also investigate whether social tagging behaviour can be managed.

UPON Methontology of development ontologies was followed to create OTO ontology, and was implemented by using Protege-OWL. Accuracy of OTO ontology was assessed using a set of ontology design criteria. This paper describes a software engineering approach to model domain ontology for occupational therapy resources (OTO) using Natural Language Programming (NLP) technology. The rules were written to annotate the domain concepts using Java Annotation Patterns Engine (JAPE) grammar. It is used to support regular expression matching and thus annotate OT concepts by using the GATE developer tool. This speeds up the time-consuming development of the ontology, which is important for experts in the domain who face time constraints and high workloads.

Here the aim was to automatically organize textual documents into hierarchical structures for subject browsing. The string-matching approach was tested using a controlled vocabulary (containing pre-selected and pre-defined authorized terms, each corresponding to only one concept). The results imply that an appropriate controlled vocabulary, with a sufficient number of entry terms designating classes, could in itself be a solution for automated classification. Then, if the same controlled vocabulary had an appropriate hierarchical structure, it would at the same time provide a good browsing structure for the collection of automatically classified documents.",autom method around sever decad exponenti growth world wide web forefront research commun sever identifi machin learn algorithm allow comput improv perform learn exist data document cluster algorithm unsupervis document autom topic extract string match algorithm match given string larger text aim automat textual document hierarch structur brows string match test use control vocabulari contain select defin correspond concept result impli appropri control vocabulari suffici number entri design class could solut autom control vocabulari appropri hierarch structur time brows structur collect automat classifi document

276,068-575-306-450-958,Train Case,"Modelling bibliographical entities is a prominent activity within knowledge organization today. Current models of bibliographic entities, such as Functional Requirements for Bibliographical Records (FRBR) and the Bibliographic Framework (BIBFRAME), take inspiration from data-modelling methods developed by computer scientists from the mid-1970s on. Thus, it would seem that the modelling of bibliographic entities is an activity of very recent vintage. However, it is possible to find examples of bibliographical models from earlier periods of knowledge organization. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to one such model, outlined by the early 20th-century British classification theorist E. Wyndham Hulme in his essay on “Principles of Book Classification” (1911–1912). There, Hulme set forth a classification of various attributes by which books can conceivably be classified. These he first divided into accidental and inseparable attributes. Accidental attributes were subdivided into edition-level and copy-level attributes and inseparable attitudes, into physical and non-physical attributes. Comparison of Hulme’s classification of attributes with those of FRBR and BIBFRAME 2.0 reveals that the different classes of attributes in Hulme’s classification correspond to groups of attributes associated with different bibliographical entities in those models. These later models assume the existence of different bibliographic entities in an abstraction hierarchy among which attributes are distributed, whereas Hulme posited only a single entity— the book—, whose various aspects he clustered into different classes of attributes. Thus, Hulme’s model offers an interesting alternative to current assumptions about how to conceptualize the relationship between attributes and entities in the bibliographical universe.",model bibliograph entiti promin activ current model bibliograph entiti function requir bibliograph record bibliograph framework bibfram take inspir data model method comput scientist mid 1970 seem model bibliograph entiti activ recent vintag howev possibl find exampl bibliograph model earlier period purpos draw attent model outlin earli centuri british theorist wyndham hulm essay principl book 1911 1912 hulm forth variou attribut book conceiv classifi first divid accident insepar attribut accident attribut subdivid edit level copi level attribut insepar attitud physic physic attribut comparison hulm attribut bibfram reveal class attribut hulm correspond group attribut associ bibliograph entiti model later model assum exist bibliograph entiti abstract hierarchi among attribut distribut wherea hulm posit singl entiti book whose variou aspect cluster class attribut hulm model offer interest altern current assumpt conceptu relationship attribut entiti bibliograph univers

And yet, a question still seems unanswered: how was its literature classified and retrieved? It is a subject that has been given surprisingly little attention by the field of library-and-information science―indeed, by scholarship in general. Furthermore, a certain way of thinking has influenced the few answers that have so far been attempted. It is as if the scholars of our era have tried to identify the modern, physical library in the Hellenistic library in Alexandria. But such an approach is biased in a basic way: It simply does not consider the impact of the cultural and intellectual context of the library. This article differs fundamentally, because I reject the notion that the library was like those of today. Accordingly, an entirely new way of understanding how the library actually worked, in terms of classification and retrieval processes is presented. The key element is to understand the library both as a physical structure and as a struc- ture in the memory of the Alexandrian scholars. In this article, these structures are put together so as to propose a new interpretation of the library.",millennia famou hellenist alexandria prais epicent enlighten wisdom question still seem unansw literatur classifi retriev given surprisingli littl attent inde scholarship gener furthermor certain think influenc answer far attempt scholar era tri identifi modern physic hellenist alexandria bias basic simpli consid impact cultur intellectu context articl fundament reject notion like accordingli entir new understand actual retriev process key element understand physic structur struc ture memori alexandrian scholar articl structur togeth propos new interpret

From the very beginning, UDC was designed to represent the universe of knowledge as an integral whole allowing for subjects/concepts from all fields of knowledge to be combined, linked and the nature of their relationships made explicit. In Otlet's original design, the emphasis for his new type of classification was on the coordination of classmarks at the point of searching, i.e., post-coordination, which he firmly rooted in an expressive notational system. While some UDC classes exhibit various patterns of facet analytical theory proper, others, although used in an analytico-synthetic fashion, follow less canonical structural patterns. The authors highlight the lack of connection made throughout the various stages of UDC restructuring between: a) theoretical requirements of an overarching facet analytical theory as a founding principle guiding the construction of schedules; and, b) practical requirements for an analytico-synthetic classification in terms of notational presentation and data structure that enables its use in indexing and retrieval, as well as its management online.",look pattern facet analysi use udc schedul affect scheme underli data structur manag scheme begin udc design repres univers integr whole allow concept combin link natur relationship made explicit otlet origin design emphasi new type coordin classmark search post coordin firmli root express notat system udc class exhibit variou pattern facet analyt theori proper other although use analytico synthet fashion follow less canon structur pattern highlight lack connect made throughout variou stage udc restructur theoret requir overarch facet analyt theori found principl guid construct schedul practic requir analytico synthet notat data structur enabl use retriev manag onlin

In response, many organizations have deployed some form of enterprise search to improve the ˜findability of information. Debates persist as to whether thesauri and manual indexing or automated machine learning techniques should be used to enhance discovery of information. In addition, the extent to which a Knowledge Organization System (KOS) enhances discoveries or indeed blinds us to new ones remains a moot point. The oil and gas industry is used as a case study using a representative organization. Drawing on prior research, a theoretical model is presented which aims to overcome the shortcomings of each approach. This synergistic model could help re-conceptualize the ˜manual versus ˜automatic debate in many enterprises, accommodating a broader range of information needs. This may enable enterprises to develop more effective information and knowledge management strategies and ease the tension between what is often perceived as mutually exclusive competing approaches.

Facet analysis is used to examine this area of music classification and as the basis of a model for classifying ensembles. The conceptual analysis is aided by examples drawn from two classification schemes, British Catalogue of Music Classification (BCMC) and Flexible Classification. First, this exploration reveals that there are conceptually four sub-facets for classifying instrument ensembles, and that the omission of any of these sub-facets causes issues within classification schemes. Next, the different type of relationships between pairs of these sub-facets is delineated, including hierarchical and associative relationships. The classification of ensembles is depicted in a novel way, as a series of inter-connected relationships between sub-facets. Finally, the article ascertains exactly what is being counted, including introducing potential extra sets of sub-facets pertaining to performers and hands. So, facet analysis helps to create a model for classifying instrumental ensembles which provides a novel solution to this historically problematic area of music classification, as well as suggesting a potentially generalizable new way of thinking about complex relationships between sub-facets",articl consid particularli knotti aspect classifi notat music instrument ensembl ensemblesi defin music written multipl player player facet analysi use examin area music basi model classifi ensembl conceptu analysi aid exampl drawn scheme british catalogu music bcmc flexibl first explor reveal conceptu facet classifi instrument ensembl omiss facet caus issu scheme next type relationship pair facet delin hierarch associ relationship ensembl depict novel seri inter connect relationship facet final articl ascertain exactli count introduc potenti extra set facet pertain perform hand facet analysi help creat model classifi instrument ensembl novel solut histor problemat area music suggest potenti generaliz new think complex relationship facet

We explore a string-matching algorithm based on a controlled vocabulary, which does not require training documents--instead it reuses the intellectual work put into creating the controlled vocabulary. Terms from the Engineering Information thesaurus and classification scheme were matched against title and abstract of engineering papers from the Compendex database. Simple string-matching was enhanced by several methods such as term weighting schemes and cut-offs, exclusion of certain terms, and enrichment of the controlled vocabulary with automatically extracted terms. The best results are 76% recall when the controlled vocabulary is enriched with new terms, and 79% precision when certain terms are excluded. Precision of individual classes is up to 98%.

To provide a foundation for research evaluation from the perspective of innovativeness, we propose an automatic approach for extracting innovative ideas from the abstracts of technology and engineering papers. The approach extracts N-grams as candidates based on part-of-speech tagging and determines whether they are novel by checking the Scopus® database to determine whether they had ever been presented previously. Moreover, we discussed the distributions of innovative ideas in different abstract structures. To improve the performance by excluding noisy N-grams, a list of stop-words and a list of research description characteristics were developed.

This classification system was originally designed for musical instruments and books about instruments, and was first published in German in 1914. Hornbostel-Sachs has dominated organological discourse and practice since its creation, and this article analyses the scheme’s context, background, versions and impact. The position of Hornbostel-Sachs in the history and development of instrument classification is explored. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the mechanics of the scheme, including its decimal notation, the influential broad categories of the scheme, its warrant, and its typographical layout. The version history of the scheme is outlined and the relationships between versions is visualised, including its translations, the introduction of the electrophones category, and the Musical Instruments Museums Online (MIMO) version designed for a digital environment. The reception of Hornbostel-Sachs is analysed, and its usage, criticism and impact are all considered. As well as dominating organological research and practice for over a century, it is shown that Hornbostel-Sachs also had a significant influence on the bibliographic classification of music.",discuss hornbostel sach music instrument system origin design music instrument book instrument first publish german 1914 hornbostel sach domin organolog discours practic sinc creation articl analys scheme context background version impact posit hornbostel sach histori instrument explor follow detail analysi mechan scheme decim notat influenti broad categori scheme warrant typograph layout version histori scheme outlin relationship version visualis translat introduct electrophon categori music instrument museum onlin mimo version design digit environ recept hornbostel sach analys usag critic impact consid domin organolog research practic centuri shown hornbostel sach signific influenc bibliograph music

The phenomenon of bias or discrimination in machine ethics is seen as inherited from humans, either through the use of biased data or through the semantics inherent in intellectually-built tools sourced by intelligent agents. The kind of biases observed in AI are compared with those identified in the field of knowledge organization, using religious adherents as an example of a community potentially marginalized by bias. A practical demonstration is given of apparent religious prejudice inherited from source material in a large database deployed widely in computational linguistics and automatic indexing. Methods to address the problem of bias are discussed, including the modelling of the moral process on neuroscientific understanding of brain function. The question is posed whether it is possible to model religious belief in a similar way, so that robots of the future may have both an ethical and a religious sense and themselves address the problem of prejudice. </p>",trace discuss around ethic issu artifici intellig consid human affect use machin learn phenomenon discrimin machin ethic seen inherit human either use bias data semant inher intellectu built tool sourc intellig agent kind bias observ ai compar identifi use religi adher exampl commun potenti margin practic demonstr given appar religi prejudic inherit sourc materi larg databas deploy wide comput linguist automat method address problem discuss model moral process neuroscientif understand brain function question pose whether possibl model religi belief similar robot futur ethic religi sens address problem prejudic

Facets have traditionally been used to organize document collections and to express complex subjects. In the digital world, they act as filters to facilitate navigation and improve retrieval. But the popularity of the term does not mean that a definitive characterization of the concept has been established. Indeed, several conceptualizations of the facet co-exist.

Archival arrangement represents a form of bricolage that archivists have been practicing for years. By organizing records according to provenance, archivists engage in knowledge creation. Archival theory holds that records are created as an output from social and bureaucratic processes. Archival description, then, could serve as a form of archival record, bearing evidence of the processes of archival arrangement. Current participatory and community-based approaches to archival description urgently require an evidential record of their processes of community consultation and professional mediation. This paper examines two Canadian community-based, participatory archival projects. Project Naming, at Library and Archives Canada, draws upon Inuit community contributions to augment the often sparse and sometimes offensive descriptions of historic photos of arctic peoples. The Sex Work Database at the University of Manitoba, works with sex work activists to create and apply a tagging folksonomy to a collection of websites, organizational records and news media. Analysis of these diverse, community-based projects reveals how current approaches to description make it difficult to distinguish between professional and community contributions to arrangement and description, and proposes ways to make such contributions more apparent. </p>",remix bricolag recogn primari mode creation contemporari digit cultur archiv arrang repres form bricolag archivist practic year record accord proven archivist engag creation archiv theori hold record creat output social bureaucrat process archiv descript could serv form archiv record bear evid process archiv arrang current participatori commun archiv descript urgent requir evidenti record process commun consult profession mediat examin canadian commun participatori archiv project project name archiv canada draw upon inuit commun contribut augment often spars sometim offens descript histor photo arctic peopl sex databas univers manitoba sex activist creat appli tag folksonomi collect websit organiz record news media analysi divers commun project reveal current descript make difficult distinguish profession commun contribut arrang descript propos make contribut appar

The current instantiation of the classification dates from 2015. The classification is currently made up of two classes—D for the sciences broadly, and E for interdisciplinary areas. The NARCIS Classification is designed specifically and with care for the contents of the NARCIS data portal. The classification mostly represents the sciences. A few anomalous situations are visible in the ontology of the classification: the humanities occupy one division within the sciences, placed between the life sciences and law; and, the treatment of interdisciplinarity, for which a separate class E is set aside for interdisciplinary sciences. A dump of the NARCIS database was used to analyze the population of the NARCIS classification. The life sciences occupy 34% of the NARCIS database. A framework for research networking systems reveals the NARCIS database and its classification most objectives, with the only lapse being the output of entities and attributes to ontologies. The NARCIS Classification is also an occupational classification. The NARCIS classification supports a vital research portal that, in turn, supports a nationally-coordinated research effort designed to provide better inter-institutional communication of scholarly productivity, thus is in itself an information institution, in which domain-dependence is part of its cultural imperative. The NARCIS Classification incorporates an example of top-down politics in which funded disciplines are included and best represented. A perhaps unintended consequence is the encapsulation of forced views.

HCFOC uses the human-centric approach, improvised with the idea of selective dissemination of information (SDI), to deal with context. Further, this ontology construction process makes use of facet analysis and an analytico-synthetic classification approach. This novel fusion contributes to the originality of HCFOC and distinguishes it from other existing ontology construction methodologies. Based on HCFOC, an ontology of the tourism domain has been designed using the Protégé-5.5.0 ontology editor. The HCFOC methodology has provided the necessary flexibility, extensibility, robustness and has facilitated the capturing of background knowledge. It models the tourism ontology in such a way that it is able to deal with the context of a tourist’s information need with precision. This is evident from the result that more than 90% of the user’s queries were successfully met. The use of domain knowledge and techniques from both library and information science and computer science has helped in the realization of the desired purpose of this ontology construction process. It is envisaged that HCFOC will have implications for ontology developers. The demonstrated tourism ontology can support any tourism information retrieval system. </p>",propos ontolog build method call human centric facet ontolog construct hcfoc hcfoc use human centric improvis idea select dissemin deal context ontolog construct process make use facet analysi analytico synthet novel fusion contribut origin hcfoc distinguish exist ontolog construct methodolog hcfoc ontolog tourism domain design use prot ontolog editor hcfoc methodolog necessari flexibl extens robust facilit captur background model tourism ontolog abl deal context tourist precis evid result queri success use domain techniqu comput help realiz desir purpos ontolog construct process envisag hcfoc implic ontolog demonstr tourism ontolog support tourism retriev system

A search was conducted on GSC using keywords in order to create a list of scholars who declared the knowledge organization domain as one of their research interests in their Google Scholar Profiles (GSPs). Next, the search for GSPs of authors who had published their papers in the Knowledge Organization journal from 2000 to 2019 was conducted. The results showed that there were 379 publicly available GSPs. Analysis of the affiliated institutions showed that the majority of them were based respectively in the USA, Brazil, and then in India.

314,034-374-636-579-338,Train Case,"<p> Fiction content analysis and retrieval are interesting specific topics for two major reasons: 1) the extensive use of fictional works; and, 2) the multimodality and interpretational nature of fiction. The primary challenge in the analysis of fictional content is that there is no single meaning to be analysed; the analysis is an ongoing process involving an interaction between the text produced by author, the reader and the society in which the interaction occurs. Furthermore, different audiences have specific needs to be taken into consideration. This article explores the topic of fiction knowledge organization, including both classification and indexing. It provides a broad and analytical overview of the literature as well as describing several experimental approaches and developmental projects for the analysis of fictional content. Traditional fiction indexing has been mainly based on the factual aspects of the work; this has then been expanded to handle different aspects of the fictional work. There have been attempts made to develop vocabularies for fiction indexing. All the major classification schemes use the genre and language/culture of fictional works when subdividing fictional works into subclasses. The evolution of shelf classification of fiction and the appearance of different types of digital tools have revolutionized the classification of fiction, making it possible to integrate both indexing and classification of fictional works.</p>",fiction content analysi retriev interest specif topic major reason extens use fiction multimod interpret natur fiction primari challeng analysi fiction content singl mean analys analysi ongo process involv interact text produc reader societi interact occur furthermor audienc specif taken consider articl explor topic fiction broad analyt overview literatur describ sever experiment development project analysi fiction content tradit fiction mainli factual aspect expand handl aspect fiction attempt made vocabulari fiction major scheme use genr languag cultur fiction subdivid fiction subclass evolut shelf fiction appear type digit tool revolution fiction make possibl integr fiction

In order to better understand this trend, the researchers interviewed seven school librarians regarding their motivations for genrefying their libraries’ fiction collections; the challenges they encountered during or after the genrefication process; and any benefits they perceived as having resulted in the implementation of genrefication. The data suggest that the librarians’ interests in genrefication stem mostly from the lack of time they have to help individual students find materials, and the lack of time students are given out of the instructional day to explore the libraries’ fiction collections. The participants felt that reclassifying the library’s fiction collection by genre gave students more ownership of the fiction collection and allowed them to find materials that genuinely interested them. The significant challenges the librarians faced in the reorganization process speak to challenges regarding the ways in which librarians attempt to provide access to diverse materials for all patrons. </p>",instructor master program observ sharp increas student desir adopt reader interest genref school fiction collect order better understand trend research interview seven school librarian regard motiv genrefi fiction collect challeng encount genref process benefit perceiv result implement genref data suggest librarian interest genref stem mostli lack time help individu student find materi lack time student given instruct day explor fiction collect particip felt reclassifi fiction collect genr gave student ownership fiction collect allow find materi genuin interest signific challeng librarian face reorgan process speak challeng regard librarian attempt access divers materi patron

Who is participating in this discipline’s scholarly discussion, and from what locations, both geographically and intellectually? Using the unit of authorship in the journal Knowledge Organization, where is the nexus of KO activity and what patterns of authorship can be identified? Cultural characteristics were applied as a lens to explore who is and is not participating in the international conversation about KO.

A constructivist/interpretivist research paradigm was used in the study. A combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches was used to build the taxonomy. Facet analysis of disaster management, the timeframe of disaster management, and modular design were performed when designing the taxonomy. Two case studies were done to demonstrate the usefulness of the taxonomy for organizing and sharing information. The facet-based taxonomy can be used to organize online information for browsing and navigation. It can also be used to index and tag online information resources to support searching. It creates a common language for earthquake management stakeholders to share knowledge. The top three level categories of the taxonomy can be applied to the management of other types of disasters. The taxonomy has implications for earthquake online information management, knowledge management and disaster management.

The semantic gap in multimedia IR remains a significant problem in the field, and solutions to them are many years off.

A work consists of abstract intellectual content that is distinct from any object that is its carrier. In library and information science, the importance of the work lies squarely with the problem of information retrieval. Works are mentefacts-intellectual (or mental) constructs that serve as artifacts of the cultures in which they arise. The meaning of a work is abstract at every level, from its creator’s conception of it, to its reception and inherence by its consumers. Works are a kind of informing object and are subject to the phenomenon of instantiation, or realization over time. Research has indicated a base typology of instantiation. The problem for information retrieval is to simultaneously collocate and disambiguate large sets of instantiations. Cataloging and bibliographc tradition stipulate an alphabetico-classed arrangement of works based on an authorship principle. FRBR provided an entity-relationship schema for enhanced control of works in future catalogs, which has been incorporated into RDA.

325,066-382-980-653-77X,Test Case,"<p>Charles Peirce’s classification of the sciences was designed shortly after the turn of the twentieth century. The classification has two main sources of inspiration: Comte’s science classification and Kant’s theoretical philosophy. Peirce’s classification, like that of Comte, is hierarchically organised in that the more general and abstract sciences provide principles for the less general and more concrete sciences. However, Peirce includes and assigns a superordinate role to philosophical disciplines which analyse and provide logical, methodological and ontological principles for the specialised sciences, and which are based on everyday life experience. Moreover, Peirce recognises two main branches of specialised empirical science: the natural sciences, on the one hand, and the social sciences, the humanities and psychology on the other. While both branches share logical and methodological principles, they are based on different ontological principles in studying physical nature and the human mind and its products, respectively. Peirce’s most basic philosophical discipline, phenomenology, transforms his early engagement with Kant. Peirce’s classification of aesthetics, ethics and logic as normative sub-disciplines of philosophy relate to his philosophical pragmatism. Yet his more overarching division between theoretical (philosophical and specialised) sciences and practical sciences may be seen as problematic. Taking Peirce’s historical account of scientific developments into consideration, however, I argue that his science classification and its emphasis on the interdependencies between the sciences could be seen as sustaining and supporting interdisciplinarity and interaction across fields of research, even across the divide between theoretical and practical sciences. </p>",charl peirc design shortli turn twentieth centuri main sourc inspir comt kant theoret philosophi peirc like comt hierarch organis gener abstract principl less gener concret howev peirc assign superordin role philosoph disciplin analys logic methodolog ontolog principl specialis everyday life experi moreov peirc recognis main branch specialis empir natur hand social human psycholog branch share logic methodolog principl ontolog principl physic natur human mind product respect peirc basic philosoph disciplin phenomenolog transform earli engag kant peirc aesthet ethic logic norm disciplin philosophi relat philosoph pragmat overarch divis theoret philosoph specialis practic seen problemat take peirc histor account scientif consider howev argu emphasi interdepend could seen sustain support interdisciplinar interact across research even across divid theoret practic

Yet, the concept is often not very well defined or even explicitly discussed when used in knowledge organisation and related fields. The aim of this article is to encourage and facilitate further reflections on academic disciplines, while at the same time offering insights on how this elusive concept might be understood. An overarching argument is that “discipline” should foremost be understood in relation to institutional and organisational features, and this is what distinguishes it from related terms such as, field, domain or topic. The etymology and history of the concept are reviewed along with a discussion of attempts to define and conceptualise disciplines. Insights are offered on how disciplines might be studied. Regardless of our views of disciplines, either as inherently out-dated constructs or as important features of a well-functioning academia, it is concluded that further precision or care in explicating the concept is needed. </p>",disciplin commonli use denot particular area research educ concept often defin even explicitli discuss use organis relat aim articl encourag facilit reflect academ disciplin time offer insight elus concept might understood overarch argument disciplin foremost understood relat institut organis featur distinguish relat domain topic etymolog histori concept review along discuss attempt defin conceptualis disciplin insight offer disciplin might regardless view disciplin either inher date construct import featur function academia conclud precis care explic concept

She traces her changing perspectives on how classifications should be viewed and evaluated by posing the following questions: 1) How does the classification process enable or constrain knowing about something or discovering something we did not already know?; 2) In what ways might we develop classifications that enhance our ability to discover meaningful information in the information stores that form a part of our scholarly as well as our everyday lives?; and 3) How might classifications mask or distort knowledge, and how might they serve to disenfranchise people and ideas? These questions are considered through a discussion of classification structures, personal classification, the link of classification to theory, everyday working classifications, translation of classifications, cognitive aspects, browsing, genres, warrant, and the difficulties of navigating complex ontological commitments.

This mirrors debates within the philosophy of language, where the concept of representation has similarly evaded satisfactory definition. This paper proposes that we abandon the strong sense of the word aboutness, which seems to promise some inherent relationship between work and subject, or between word and world. Instead, we seek an etymological reset to the sense of aboutness of “in the vicinity, nearby; in some place or various places nearby; all over a surface.” To distinguish this sense, we introduce the term episemantics. The authors have each independently applied this term in slightly different contexts and scales (Hauser 2018a; J. T. Tennis 2016), and this article presents a unified definition of the term and guidelines for applying it at the scale of both words and works. The resulting weak concept of aboutness is pragmatic, in Star’s sense of a focus on consequences over antecedents, while reserving space for the critique and improvement of aboutness determinations within various contexts and research programs.

This paper builds on that research in order to further understand the comparative impact of the NARCIS Classification alongside a classification designed specifically for information resources. Our six cases come from the DANS project Knowledge Organi- zation System Observatory (KOSo), which itself is classified using the Information Coding Classification (ICC) created in 1982 by Ingetraut Dahlberg.

Since then, provenance and document context have supported the organization of archival knowledge (especially through classification and description procedures). Such relationships were gradually refined over the years and from different experiences between European archives and their classification and ordering systems. Historically, the principle of provenance is a pivotal moment in the development of archival theory, crucial to understanding the nature of records and archives. However, in archival theory, the principle of provenance still does not correspond to a single term or a single definition and scarce normalization terminology remains one of the problems of archival science, which leads to a lack of consensus about the division between the two principles of provenance and original order. Recently, the concept of provenance has been addressed by many other disciplines (law, library and information science, computer science and visual analytics) and applied to different domains (cloud-based storage, preservation of digital records, digital evidence, digital humanities, e-science, open data, linked data, knowledge organization and indexing.

The aim is to systematize the relations between knowledge organization and archival science within the scope of classification and description. Bibliographic research in ISKO literature and archival literature was performed. Through systematization, it was possible to understand how the relationship between these fields is carried out and how it can be strengthened. The field of knowledge organization makes a pivotal contribution to the development of methodologies to access information. A series of developments in languages, structures and classifications, that is, knowledge organization systems (KOSs), is presented. On the other hand, archival science has been developing simultaneously, but in many moments seeking interlocutions, although superficial or even unintentional with the field of knowledge organization. The approximation of these fields is essential for the development of archival classification and description, aiming for the construction of ontologies, taxonomies and controlled vocabularies among others. These recent approximations must have occurred due to the changes that have happened in the last twenty years in relation to records management and the way people build knowledge and seek information. Also, it is possible to apply KOSs in the administrative digital environment for better archival representation instruments.  </p>",discuss aspect contact archiv text publish scope intern societi especi concern descript build theoret conceptu parallel contact aim systemat relat archiv scope descript bibliograph research isko literatur archiv literatur perform systemat possibl understand relationship carri strengthen make pivot contribut methodolog access seri languag structur system koss hand archiv simultan mani moment seek interlocut although superfici even unintent approxim essenti archiv descript aim construct ontolog taxonomi control vocabulari among other recent approxim must occur due chang happen last twenti year relat record manag peopl build seek possibl appli koss administr digit environ better archiv represent instrument
351,140-120-127-320-865,Train Case,"<p>The purpose of this research is to develop an ontology with subsequent testing and evaluation, for identifying utility and value. The domain that has been chosen is human nervous system (HNS) disorders. It is hypothesized here that an ontology-based patient records management system is more effective in meeting and addressing complex information needs of health-care personnel. Therefore, this study has been based on the premise that developing an ontology and using it as a component of the search interface in hospital records management systems will lead to more efficient and effective management of health-care. It is proposed here to develop an ontology of the domain of HNS disorders using a standard vocabulary such as MeSH or SNOMED CT. The principal classes of an ontology include facet analysis for arranging concepts based on their common characteristics to build mutually exclusive classes. We combine faceted theory with description logic, which helps us to better query and retrieve data by implementing an ontological model. Protégé 5.2.0 was used as ontology editor. The use of ontologies for domain modelling will be of acute help to doctors for searching patient records. In this paper we show how the faceted approach helps us to build a flexible model and retrieve better information. We use the medical domain as a case study to show examples and implementation. </p>",purpos research ontolog subsequ test evalu identifi util valu domain chosen human nervou system disord hypothes ontolog patient record manag system effect meet address complex health care personnel therefor premis ontolog use compon search interfac hospit record manag system lead effici effect manag health care propos ontolog domain disord use standard vocabulari snome ct princip class ontolog facet analysi arrang concept common characterist build mutual exclus class combin facet theori descript logic help better queri retriev data implement ontolog model prot use ontolog editor use ontolog domain model acut help doctor search patient record show facet help build flexibl model retriev better use medic domain case show exampl implement
352,144-109-666-243-086,Test Case,"<p>Recent years have seen the rise of user-generated contents (UGCs) in online social media. Diverse UGC sources and information overload are making it increasingly difficult to satisfy personalized information needs. To organize UGCs in a user-centered way, we should not only map them based on textual topics but also link them with users and even user communities. We propose a multi-dimensional framework to organize information by connecting UGCs, users, and user communities. First, we use a topic model to generate a topic hierarchy from UGCs. Second, an author-topic model is applied to learn user interests. Third, user communities are detected through a label propagation algorithm. Finally, a multi-dimensional information organization pattern is formulated based on similarities among the topic hierarchies of UGCs, user interests, and user communities. The results reveal that: 1) our proposed framework can organize information from multiple sources in a user-centered way; 2) hierarchical topic structures can provide comprehensive and in-depth topics for users; and, 3) user communities are efficient in helping people to connect with others who have similar interests.</p>",recent year seen rise gener content ugc onlin social media divers ugc sourc overload make increasingli difficult satisfi person ugc center map textual topic link even commun propos multi dimension framework connect ugc commun first use topic model gener topic hierarchi ugc second topic model appli learn interest third commun detect label propag algorithm final multi dimension pattern formul similar among topic hierarchi ugc interest commun result reveal propos framework multipl sourc center hierarch topic structur comprehens depth topic commun effici help peopl connect other similar interest
353,145-162-485-543-214,Train Case,"<p>Aboutness ranks amongst our field’s greatest bugbears. What is a work about? How can this be known? This mirrors debates within the philosophy of language, where the concept of representation has similarly evaded satisfactory definition. This paper proposes that we abandon the strong sense of the word aboutness, which seems to promise some inherent relationship between work and subject, or, in philosophical terms, between word and world. Instead, we seek an etymological reset to the older sense of aboutness as “in the vicinity, nearby; in some place or various places nearby; all over a surface.” To distinguish this sense in the context of information studies, we introduce the term episemantics. The authors have each independently applied this term in slightly different contexts and scales (Hauser 2018a; Tennis 2016), and this article presents a unified definition of the term and guidelines for applying it at the scale of both words and works. The resulting weak concept of aboutness is pragmatic, in Star’s sense of a focus on consequences over antecedents, while reserving space for the critique and improvement of aboutness determinations within various contexts and research programs. The paper finishes with a discussion of the implication of the concept of episemantics and methodological possibilities it offers for knowledge organization research and practice. We draw inspiration from Melvil Dewey’s use of physical aroundness in his first classification system and ask how aroundness might be more effectively operationalized in digital environments. </p>",about rank amongst greatest bugbear known mirror debat philosophi languag concept represent similarli evad satisfactori definit propos abandon strong sens word about seem promis inher relationship philosoph word world instead seek etymolog reset older sens about vicin nearbi place variou place nearbi surfac distinguish sens context introduc episemant independ appli slightli context scale hauser 2018a tenni 2016 articl unifi definit guidelin appli scale word result weak concept about pragmat star sens focu consequ anteced reserv space critiqu improv about determin variou context research program finish discuss implic concept episemant methodolog possibl offer research practic draw inspir melvil dewey use physic around first system ask around might effect operation digit environ
354,152-347-604-820-830,Train Case,"<p>The Basics Concept Classification (BCC) is a “universal” scheme: it attempts to encompass all areas of human understanding. Whereas most universal schemes are organized around scholarly disciplines, the BCC is instead organized around phenomena (things), the relationships that exist among phenomena, and the properties that phenomena and relators may possess. This structure allows the BCC to apply facet analysis without requiring the use of “facet indicators.” The main motivation for the BCC was a recognition that existing classifications that are organized around disciplines serve interdisciplinary scholarship poorly. Complex concepts that might be understood quite differently across groups and individuals can generally be broken into basic concepts for which there is enough shared understanding for the purposes of classification. Documents, ideas, and objects are classified synthetically by combining entries from the schedules of phenomena, relators, and properties. The inclusion of separate schedules of-generally verb-like-relators is one of the most unusual aspects of the BCC. This (and the schedules of properties that serve as adjectives or adverbs) allows the production of sentence-like subject strings. Documents can then be classified in terms of the main arguments made in the document. BCC provides very precise descriptors of documents by combining phenomena, relators, and properties synthetically. The terminology employed in the BCC reduces terminological ambiguity. The BCC is still being developed and it needs to be fleshed out in certain respects. Yet it also needs to be applied; only in application can the feasibility and desirability of the classification be adequately assessed. </p>",basic concept univers scheme attempt encompass area human understand wherea univers scheme around scholarli disciplin instead around phenomena thing relationship exist among phenomena properti phenomena relat possess structur allow appli facet analysi without requir use facet indic main motiv recognit exist around disciplin serv interdisciplinari scholarship poorli complex concept might understood quit across group individu gener broken basic concept enough share understand purpos document idea object classifi synthet combin entri schedul phenomena relat properti inclus separ schedul gener verb like relat unusu aspect schedul properti serv adject adverb allow product sentenc like string document classifi main argument made document precis descriptor document combin phenomena relat properti synthet terminolog employ reduc terminolog ambigu still flesh certain respect appli applic feasibl desir adequ assess
355,173-877-453-721-519,Train Case,"<p>By using the metadata for the fonds of “Chen Cheng-po’s Paintings and Documents” (CCP) in the database of the Archives of the Institute of Taiwan History (IHT, Academia Sinica, Taiwan), we develop and enhance a semantic data model for converting the data into a linked data project, focusing on data modeling, data reconciliation, and data enrichment. The research questions are: 1) How can we keep the original rich and contextual information of the archival materials during a LOD task?; 2) How can we integrate heterogeneous datasets about the same real-world resources from libraries, archives, and museums, while keeping the different views distinct?; and, (3) How can we provide added value for semantic metadata of archives in terms of instance-based and schema-based types of enrichment? The project adopts the Europeana Data Model (EDM) as the main model and extends the properties to fit the contextual characteristics of archival materials. Various methods are explored to preserve the hierarchical structure and context of the archival materials, to enrich semantic data, and to connect data from different sources and institutions. We propose four approaches to enriching data semantics by: 1) directly using external vocabularies; 2) reconciling local links to other linked data sources; 3) introducing contextual classes for the appropriate contextual entities; and, 4) utilizing named entity extraction. The results can contribute to the best practice for developing linked data for art-related archival materials. </p>",use metadata fond chen cheng paint document databas archiv institut taiwan histori academia sinica taiwan enhanc semant data model convert data link data project focus data model data reconcili data enrich research question origin rich contextu archiv materi lod task integr heterogen dataset world resourc archiv museum view distinct ad valu semant metadata archiv instanc schema type enrich project adopt europeana data model main model extend properti fit contextu characterist archiv materi variou method explor preserv hierarch structur context archiv materi enrich semant data connect data sourc institut propos enrich data semant directli use extern vocabulari reconcil local link link data sourc introduc contextu class appropri contextu entiti util name entiti extract result contribut best practic link data art relat archiv materi
356,187-701-961-076-877,Train Case,"Knowledge organization (KO) is considered a distinctive disciplinary focus of information science, with strong connections to other intellectual domains such as philosophy, computer science, psychology, sociology, and more. Given its inherent interdisciplinarity, we ask what might a map of the physical, cultural and intellectual geography of the KO community look like? Who is participating in this discipline’s scholarly discussion, and from what locations, both geographically and intellectually? Using the unit of authorship in the journal Knowledge Organization, where is the nexus of KO activity, and what patterns of authorship can be identified? What indices can be generated to describe the KO community of researchers as it has evolved? Cultural characteristics were applied as a lens to explore who is and is not participating in the international conversation about KO. World Bank GNI per capita estimates were used to compare relative wealth of countries and Hofstede’s Individualism dimension was identified as a way of understanding attributes of countries whose scholars are participating in this dialog. Descriptive statistics were generated through Excel, and data visualizations were rendered through Tableau Public and TagCrowd. The current project offers one method for examining an international and interdisciplinary field of study, but also suggests potential for analyzing other interdisciplinary areas within the larger discipline of information science.",consid distinct disciplinari focu strong connect intellectu domain philosophi comput psycholog sociolog given inher interdisciplinar ask might map physic cultur intellectu geographi commun look like particip disciplin scholarli discuss locat geograph intellectu use unit authorship journal nexu activ pattern authorship identifi indic gener describ commun research evolv cultur characterist appli len explor particip intern convers world bank gni capita estim use compar rel wealth countri hofsted individu dimens identifi understand attribut countri whose scholar particip dialog descript statist gener excel data visual render tableau public tagcrowd current project offer method examin intern interdisciplinari suggest potenti analyz interdisciplinari area larger disciplin
