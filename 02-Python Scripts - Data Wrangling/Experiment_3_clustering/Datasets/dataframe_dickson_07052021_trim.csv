The paper attempts to provoke thought about new frontiers of visual knowledge organization. Computers introduce the possibility of interchangeable media. They offer multiple nodes of access to a given term or object. They enable us to approach knowledge on different levels. A scheme of 10 levels is proposed and some consequences for visual knowledge at each of these levels is considered briefly. The final section of the paper considers four navigational tools: questions, maps, meters, and tracking"

The terse presentation should give a synopsis of the scope and method of knowledge organization applicable in a global scale.; ; The methodology used is based on a Triadic Interface Paradigm which combines dialectic and syllogic algorithms to arrive at synthetic conclusions of general applications. This holistic perspective situates the static and dynamic contents of matter, energy and information systems in their space-time context. Finally, these dimensions are manipulated by formal operational codes to produce systemic and systematic knowledge.; ; The Model has been used to demonstrate a new Theory of Sociophysics which integrates the basic principles of social and natural sciences into an all-inclusive conceptual framework. Sociophysics assumes the fundamental isomorphism of nature and culture, thereby projecting heuristic metaphors between them. As a result, it contributes in enhancing, understanding and appreciating the global picture of human reality."

As a secondary topic the scientific relations existing among Information Science, Epistemology, and the Cognitive Sciences are discussed. Classification is seen as a central activity in all daily and scientific activities, and, of course, of knowledge organization in information services. There is a mutual implication between classification and conceptualization, as the former moves in a natural way to the latter and the best result elaborated for classification is the concept. Research in concept theory is a need for a Theory of Classification. In this direction it is of outstanding importance to integrate the achievements of natural concept formation theory (NCFT) as an alternative approach to conceptualization different from the traditional one of logicians and problem solving researchers. In clonclusion both approaches are seen as being complementary: the NCFP approach being closer to the user and the logical one being more suitable for experts, including expert systems"

This article asks whether the use of the iconographic classification system ICONCLASS will help to create countable iconographic information. Its first part deals with the considerations that have guided the shape of the computer edition that has recently been made available. These may be relevant for the electronic publication of classification systems in general. In the second part a few statement about gestures are analyzed against the background of an existing corpus of systematically described images .

Pt.4 will follow in KO 24(1997)No.1. In addition to the important distinctions between the fundamental concepts and terms (tags) used in Onomantics and Terminology, as reported in the first two parts of this essay, several other interesting comparisons can be made. First, with reference to formats, both the structure and nomenclature used for terminological entries (records) in ISO 1087 parallel those found in dictionaries and suggest a semantic rather than an onomantic point of view. Second, a large number of borrowed terms taken from Lexicography and Linguistics can be found in this glossary for the terminology of Terminology. Sometimes the definitions for these terms identify them as borrowed concepts drawn from the vocabulary used by lexicographers. However, sometimes new meanings are stipulated for these terms without any markings to show that they are not borrowed concepts. Moreover, in all these cases, since the original and the newly stipulated concepts are similar, ambiguity is unavoidable. Third, some concepts that might be useful for terminologists are not included in ISO 1087: a few examples are explained. They are all concepts which lexicographers do not need and, consequently, they have no terms for them. It seems apparent that they have been omitted from the vocabulary of Terminology simply because they are new concepts without established terms. To explain the reasons for the formats, terms and omissions found in the leading glossary for the terminology of Terminology takes us into a realm of speculation that is too complicated for inclusion here, but I will discuss it in Part IV of this series, with a focus on the problems of neologisms"

To begin with, a few basic concepts from the field of communication theory are defined. The new concepts permit the conclusion that what we are facing at present is not a flood of information but one of messages, and that this latter flood must not be equated indiscriminately with a knowledge flood. Messages must be judged on their contents. To this end, «knowledge» is subdivided into «core-», «peripheral», and «pseudo-knowledge», and it is argued that the great majority of scientific publications contains peripheral and pseudoknowledge. With the aid of two interlocking and self-amplying recursive mechanisms it is shown that and how pseudoknowledge is more and more gaining disciplines, hence precisely in those fields which deal with social problems in the broadest sense of the world; Thus a deficit of knowledge on which to base action is produced, leading to a general disorientation - a modern form of ignorance, keenly manifesting it self at present in a crisis of leadership.

A table shows one hundred main concepts of sociology arranged and classified within ten major categories or sections, and their provision in the DDC. The study suggests that the DDC needs serious reconsideration with regard to the main headings/categories provided as class headings, terminology used for the concepts, the filiatory structure adopted, and the representation of the main concepts of sociology."

The concept-representing part deals with tools and forms of representing these entities and their properties and relations in some intelligent system. The linkage deals with establishing the proper correspondences between components of the base and the representing part. Each of these knowledge kinds is associated with specific structures related to concepts (symbols, names, statements, images, texts, entities and their properties and relations, procedures of determination of property values, etc.). Various informal and formal (mainly set-theoretical) specifications of these structures serve as criteria for triplet classifications of concepts"

One major idea to diminsh the miraculous impression was to view mathematics as exploring the vast area ofall kinds ofabstract structures, thus establishing a huge store of humanly possible thinking from which the physicist has only to choose the structure appropriate for the case before him. There remains, however, the problem of mathematical overdetermination ofphysics: the structures suitable for application usually contain mathematical elements that remain without physical interpretation. The true miracle then seems to be that it is often very difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate those uninterpreted elements from physical theory."

This paper approaches the language problem from just the opposite side: the given is here a certain content; what is sought for, is an appropriate artificial language to represent this content. To this end, seven elementary representation principles are proposed. To illustrate the way they work, syntactic pattern recognition is introduced as a simple, but non-trivial example for representing knowledge in formal language. Another central thema of the paper is LEIBNIZ's characteristica universalis and the so-called LEIBNIZ project. LEIBNIZ's investigations in this field are reviewed against the background of the tasks required in syntactic pattern recognition. It is demonstrated that LEIBNIZ had, in fact, already worked with six ofthe seven representation principles proposed, further, that his characteristica universalis is an early form of a formal language, and lastly, that - contrary to the prevailing view - the LEIBNIZ project is not a matter of logic but rather one of knowledge representation, a field largely unexploited in today's logic-oriented epistemology and philosophy of science. It is precisely this one-sided orientation of these disciplines, which is responsible for the distorted picture of LEIBNIZ's work found in the literature; some typical misunderstandings are finally discussed.

The paper's sections: 1. Leibniz vs. Descartes in views on knowledge. 2. On physicalism and antiphysicalism in logic. 3. Turing's claim as to the insignificance of hardware. 4. Von Neumann's claim as to the significance of hardware. 5. Why Leibniz would not have accepted logical physicalism. 6. Why Leibniz would have accepted logical physicalism. (Author)"

It progresses by association, affinity and juxtaposition of two divergent ideas in an integrative approach. To argue a case, a legal expert cannot limit himself to the perception of isolated facts, but instead must find affinities between fields expressing more cohesion in law. In this paper, it is argued that the legal specialist relies on abstract categorization to discover a precedent and thereby create a metaphorical link that serves in the argumentation stage, and also later on in the resolution of the case. On this basis, a model of case reasoning is charted that integrates a model of analogical reasoning. In the same manner, a model of analogical reasoning is designed that combines quality induction and deduction. Furthermore, it is advocated that a rich representation of a law category is required to make a good induction. Similarly, it is specified that quality induction should be constrained by abstract rules in order to preserve legal principles and compute profound similarity between cases to discover the precedent. A better grasp of analogy can help us to improve legal information retrieval as well as legal case-based reasoning"

The traditional borderline between both variations of indexing, however, should not conceal fundamental commonalities of the two approaches. For example, thesaurus construction and usage, quite common in databases, has hardly been encountered in book indexing so far. Database indexing, on the other hand, has hardly made use of subheadings of the syntax-displaying type, quite common in book indexing. Most database users also prefer precombining vocabulary units and reject concept analysis. However, insisting on precombining descriptors in a large database vocabulary may, in the long run, well be destructive to the quality of indexing and of the searches. A complementary approach is conceivable which provides both precombinations and analyzed subjects, both index language syntax and subheadings, and provides access to an information system via precombinations, without jeopardizing the manageability of the vocabulary. Such an approach causes considerable costs in input because it involves a great deal of intellectual work. On the other hand, much time and costs will be saved in the use of the system. In addition, such an approach would endow an information system with survival power."

Symbol manipulation systems had been considered by Leibniz as a methodology of inferring knowledge in a secure and purely mechanical fashion. Such inference calculi were considered as mere artefacts which could not possibly encompass all human knowledge acquisition. In Alan Turing's work one notices a crucial shift of perspective. The abstract mathematical states of a Turing machine (a kind of calculus universalis that Leibniz was looking for) are claimed to correspond to equivalent psychological states. Artefacts are turned into faithful models of human cognition. A further step toward the Computational Theory of Mind was the physical symbol system hypothesis, contending to have found a necessary and sufficient criterion for the presence of intelligence in operative mediums. This, together with Chomsky's foundational work on linguistics, led naturally to the Computational Theory of Mind as set out by Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn. We discuss problematic aspects of this theory. Then we deal with another paradigm of the Computational Theory of Mind based on network automata. This sub-symbolic paradigm seems to avoid problems occuring in symbolic computations, like the proble frame problem and graceful degradation"

We enumerate over two dozen way-stations, or phases, many heretofore vaguely differentiated in half a dozen academic disciplines. Each phase is illustrated with a vignette. Within that cycle, the mental awareness that one has found an anomaly is a distinct advantage, for which we propose the name of neocognition. Certain phases are especially vulnerable dead ends, choke-points, of the entire sequence. Particularly so are the 8 th to 10 th periods - the cultural reactions based on the perceived immediacy of benefit. Any requirement to obtain commercial support at this pre-development stage prevents the emergence of even farsighted latent support that could hurdle the remaining steps. The eventual acceptance of any Kuhnism activates forces that will likely evolve its own era of scientific / political correctness. - From a score of thumbnail histories, it becomes obvious that research organizations may accelerate basic discovery by pre-constituency dissemination"

The major systems that have predominated during the twentieth century were originally predicated on the academic disciplines. This structural principle is no longer adequate because multidisciplinary knowledge production has overtaken more traditional disciplinary perspectives and produced communities of cooperation whose documents cannot be accommodated in a disciplinary structure. This paper addresses the problems the major classifications face, reports some attempts to revise these systems to accommodate multidisciplinary works more appropriately, and describes some theoretical research perspectives that attempt to reorient classification research toward the pluralistic needs of multidisciplinary knowledge creation and the perspectives of different discourse communities. Traditionally, the primary desiderata of classification systems were mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity. The need to respond to multidisciplinary research may mean that hospitality will replace mutual exclusivity and joint exhaustivity as the most needed and useful characteristics of classification systems in both theory and practice."

Part IV, finally, offers a speculative explanation of these problems. My central hypothesis is that an aversion to neologisms - especially newly coined words - impedes the introduction and acceptance of new concepts. The pressure for standardization of terminology compounds this difficulty. There are three kinds of neologisms: 1. newly coined words (neoterisms), 2. phases composed of familiar words (phrasal tags) and 3. familiar words for which new meanings have been stipulated (meta-terms). Neologisms in the form of phrases containing familiar words are often found in ISO 1087. Some perplexing ambiguities in ISO 1087 occur when new meanings are stipulated for familiar words, creating terminological metaphors (meta-terms) that are often obscure. Such meta-terms abound in the terminology of Terminology. Increased willingness to accept well-formed new words (neoterisms) would greatly simplify the development of a more adequate terminology for Terminology. The use of pleonasms is recommended as a technique to overcome ambiguity by linking familiar words having new meanings (meta-terms) to new words for the same concepts (neoterisms) and as a simple way to facilitate the introduction of such neoterisms."

After defining the notion of information compatibility, the author shows that it meets the same care of semantic coherence as the information languages themselves. Then, relying on the lessons of linguistics and automatic translating, he describes two types of viable solutions: the harmonization of several information languages (an uneasy and costly processing); and the automatic harmonization of the indexing formulas through prefabricated concordance tables, an easier solution which can however be hampered by structural discrepancies. Last he sketches a critical view of the concept of switching language."

The core theoretical problem for IS is re- lated to the determination of the usefulness of different ""subject access points"" in electronic databases. This problem is again related to theories of meaning and semantics.2 This paper outlines some important principles in the design of documents done in the field of ""composition studies"". It maps the possible subject access points and presents research done on each kind of these. It shows how theories of IR must build on or relate to different theories of concepts and meaning. It discusses two contrasting theories of semantics worked out by Ludwig Wittgenstein: ""the picture theory"" and ""the theory of language games"" and demonstrates the different consequences for such theories for IR. Finally, the implica- tions for information professionals are discussed."

Maria Theresia Rolland proposes such a model in her book ,,Sprachverarbeitung durch Logotechnik (1994). Relying upon the language theory of Leo Weisgerber, she pursues a pure ,,content oriented approach, by which she understands an approach in terms of the semantics of words. Starting from the ,,implications of word-contents, she attempts to construct a complete grammar of the German language. The reviewer begins his comments with an immanent critique, calling attention to a number of serious contradictions in Rolland's concept, among them, her refusal to take syntax into account despite its undeniably real presence. In the second part of his comments, the reviewer then takes up his own semiotic language theory published in 1981, showing that semantics is but one of four semiotic dimensions of language, the other dimensions being the sigmatic, the pragmatic and the syntactic. Without taking all four dimensions into account, no theory can offer an adequate integrative language model. Indeed, without all four dimensions, one cannot even develop an adequate grammar of German sentence construction. The fourfold semiotic model discloses as well the universally valid structures of language as the intersubjective expression of human self-awareness. Only on the basis of these universal structures, it is argued, is it possible to identify the specific structures of a native-language, and that on all four levels. This position has important consequences for the problems of computer translation and the comparative study and use of languages"

Theoretical and practical initiatives in this area of management, however, have met with some difficulty regarding the conception of knowledge that should guide these efforts. This paper critically examines the contribution of Nonaka (1994) to this conceptual problem. While we support Nonaka's reasons for choosing a subjectivist epistemology in this managerial context, we argue that he is seriously misguided with regard to the philosophical and managerial ramifications of his choice. Consequently, we doubt whether Nonaka's views can serve as a successful paradigm for corporate knowledge management."

Terminology bridges these two approaches : it draws heavily on the lexicographic model while moving stolidly toward an onomantic framework - from a semantic focus on the meanings of words to an onomasiological concern with the identification and representation of concepts. The article is the first of a Two Part sequence in which the basic concepts and the rationale of Onomantics are identified. They provide a framework for enhancing the ability of Terminology to contribute to Knowledge Organization. The essential logic of Onomantics as the science of concept representation is explained and its general relationship to Terminology as a growing but mixed field of applications is discussed.

They include what is called representation, description, cue, tag and notation in Onomantics and, in Terminology, definition, designation, term, symbol and name. A lexicographer writing a synonymy for such words might compare their meanings to show how they resemble or differ from each other, using a Semantic (words-to-meanings) point of view. To compare concepts (not words) in an Onomantic (Ana-Semantic, or concept-to-tag) context, one needs to compare the descriptions (definitions) of each concept to see whether they, indeed, have the same or different essential characteristics. One also needs to compare the notations that situate each concept in a system - even if the definitions of two concepts are almost the same, one might discover that because two concepts are positioned differently in their respective classification schemes, they are conceptualized differently. Finally, the concept tags (terms) used to represent each concept can also be compared semantically, i.e. to see whether their connotations and additional meanings support or hamper the unambiguous recognition of each intended concept. After an introductory display of the two sets of concepts, each of those used in Terminology is compared systematically, using all three sets of comparisons, with the nearest equivalent concepts used in Onomantics"

The indexing needs of the humanities range broadly across these contrasts. The second part establishes the centrality of relationships to the communication of indexable matter and examines the advantages and disadvantages of means used for their expression in both natural languages and index languages. The use of a relational structure, such as a frame, is shown to represent perhaps the best available option. The last part illustrates where the use of relational structures in humanities indexing would help meet some of the needs previously identified.

This paper demonstrates how these different methods have been applied to the classification of psychology. An etymological approach is insufficient to define the subject matter of psychology, because other terms can be used to describe the same domain. To define the subject matter of psychology from the point of view of its formal establishment as a science and academic discipline (in Leipzig, 1879) is also insufficient because this was done in specific historical circumstances, which narrowed the subject matter to physiologically-related issues. When defining the subject area of a scientific field it is necessary to consider how different ontological and epistemological views have made their influences. A subject area and the approaches by which this subject area has been studied cannot be separated from each other without tracing their mutual historical interactions. The classification of a subject field is theory-laden and thus cannot be neutral or ahistorical. If classification research can claim to have a method that is more general than the study of the concrete developments in the single knowledge fields the key is to be found in the general epistemological theories. It is shown how basic epistemological assumptions have formed the different approaches to psychology during the 20th century. The progress in the understanding of basic philosophical questions is decisive both for the development of a knowledge field and as the point of departure of classification. The theoretical principles developed in this paper are applied in a brief analysis of some concrete classification systems, including the one used by PsycINFO / Psychological Abstracts. The role of classification in modern information retrieval is also briefly discussed."

There have been several attempts to organize the resources on the World Wide Web. Some of them have tried to use traditional library classification schemes such as the Library of Congress Classification, the Dewey Decimal Classification and others. However there is a need to assign proper subject headings to them and present them in a logical or hierarchical sequence to cater to the need for browsing. This paper attempts to describe an experimental system designed to organize and provide access to web documents using a faceted pre-coordinate indexing system based on the Deep Structure Indexing System (DSIS) derived from POPSI (Postulate based Permuted Subject Indexing) of Bhattacharyya, and the facet analysis and chain indexing system of Ranganathan. A prototype software system has been designed to create a database of records specifying Web documents according to the Dublin Core and to input a faceted subject heading according to DSIS. Synonymous terms are added to the standard terms in the heading using appropriate symbols. Once the data are entered along with a description and the URL of the web document, the record is stored in the system. More than one faceted subject heading can be assigned to a record depending on the content of the original document. The system stores the surrogates and keeps the faceted subject headings separately after establishing a link. The search is carried out on index entries derived from the faceted subject heading using the chain indexing technique. If a single term is input, the system searches for its presence in the faceted subject headings and displays the subject headings in a sorted sequence reflecting an organizing sequence. If the number of retrieved headings is too large (running into more than a page) the user has the option of entering another search term to be searched in combination. The system searches subject headings already retrieved and looks for those containing the second term. The retrieved faceted subject headings can be displayed and browsed. When the relevant subject heading is selected the system displays the records with their URLs. Using the URL, the original document on the web can be accessed. The prototype system developed in a Windows NT environment using ASP and a web server is under rigorous testing. The database and index management routines need further development."

Classificatory activity, however, serves different purposes in different situations. In information retrieval, the primary purpose of classification is to find knowledge that already exists, but one of the purposes of classification in other fields is to discover new knowledge. In this paper, classifications for information retrieval are called professional classifications because they are devised by people who have a professional interest in classification, and classifications for knowledge discovery are called naive classifications because they are devised by people who have no particular interest in studying classification as an end in itself. This paper compares the overall purposes and methods of these two kinds of classifications and provides a general model of the relationships between the two kinds of classificatory activity in the context of information studies. This model addresses issues of the influence of scholarly activity and communication on the creation and revision of classifications for the purposes of information retrieval and for the purposes of knowledge discovery. Further comparisons elucidate the relationships between the universality of classificatory methods and the specific purposes served by naive and professional classification systems."

The concept of genre is examined in relation to epistemology and to different values and views in both musicology and libraries. The point of departure is to regard music as a domain of actors, institutions and processes. A comprehensive definition of this domain is suggested, which includes several subdomains and discourses. The classical music subdomain and the popular music subdomain are introduced and related to libraries. The article further investigates the concept of paradigm in relation to musicology. It demonstrates how two different paradigms influence the way music is defined, described, classified and indexed and how they are part of a historical context. The fourth part of the article focuses on the concept of genre and the analysis of music and the relation between analytical methods and values/paradigms. In addition, this part focuses on the actors that are responsible for the verbalization of genres in music. The fifth part examines indexing of musical genres with a view to their function as subject access points in databases. The unsatisfactory state of today's practice, as well as the need of a better theoretical foundation of the concept of genre, is documented. The unsatisfactory differentiation in the organising of popular music is exemplified by Danish and Norwegian libraries, including the DK5 system and the Indeksering afmusik guidelines. Finally, arguments are put forward for developing an anthropological paradigm in relation to organizing music in libraries."

It contracts the classes on Christianity, 220-280, into one class, 220, and allows for local Korean emphasis so that religions of Asian, and especially East Asian, origin are given preferred treatment. It relocates Buddhism and other religions of Asian origin into separate divisions, 230 and 240, respectively. The recommendations maintain the basic system and order of DDC. Whenever possible, they adhere to the Korean Decimal Classification in the arrangement of religions of Asian origin. Because the options for religions other than Christianity in DDC are to give preferred treatment to a specific religion, this article tries to generalize the idea to suggest an option in DDC as Option F for > 292-299 Religions other than Christianity, for other nations in the world having similar situations. It says: Contract the Bible and Christianity in 220-280 into 220, and then class other religions to give preferred treatment in 230-280, respectively, following the order in DDC.

To facilitate research on information within hobbies, the article discusses two conceptual devices: Serious leisure (Stebbins, 1982) describes essential characteristics of leisure, establishes that some types are information-rich, and provides a framework to study leisure systematically; The collectivist theory of domain analysis (Hjorland and Albrechtsen, 1995) orients research to the hobby milieu and its objective information forms, recasting them as hobby domains. As an example of the application of both devices, a case study is reviewed of the information resources in the hobby of cooking.

These three presumptions are the notion of mutually exclusive categories, teleology in the sense of linear progression toward a goal, and hierarchy both through logical division and through the dominance of some classes over others. These three presumptions are linked to classificatory thought in the western tradition. The purpose of making these connections is to investigate the cultural specificity to western culture of widespread classificatory practice. It is a step in a larger study to examine classification as a cultural construction that may be systemically incompatible with other cultures and with marginalized elements of western culture."

The purpose of the medium-theory perspective is to trace the historicity of the LIS concept of knowledge organization, that is, an examination of which tradition has produced the concept. The perspective will help to reveal the condition of possibilities of knowledge organization and its strong connection with communication technologies, and their constitution of the social organization of society. The means and modes of communication fundamentally alter existing ways of thinking and of producing, communicating and organizing knowledge. The LIS concept of knowledge organization will be analyzed in relation to the storing and communication of knowledge in oral cultures, written cultures, print culture, and electronic cultures. Through this, it will be argued that the narrow LIS concept of knowledge organization is subordinated and in interaction with a broader social organization of knowledge in society. Further, it will be argued that the rise of the Internet as a source of knowledge and information must be understood in relation to and in continuation of this interaction. Among other things, it will be concluded that a relevant socio-historical background and framework for the LIS concept of knowledge organization is how humans have organized their intellectual activities throughout history in terms of particular means and modes of communication. Medium theory can provide part of this background and framework."

The analysis indicates that different socially and historically embedded discourses on art, including pre-paradigmatic studies and scholarly paradigms, pervade knowledge organization in the art institution at three levels, respectively: 1. Art exhibitions, 2. Primary and tertiary document types (printed, audio-visual, and multimedia documents), and 3. Classification systems, bibliographies, and thesauri. The article presents three paradigms in art scholarship (iconographic, stylistic and materialistic) and analyzes in which way, and to what extent, these paradigms are integrated in the taxonomies of the LCC, DDC, UDC, and Soviet BBK classification systems. The paper also addresses the relationship among paradigms, principles for exhibiting works of art, ways of conceptualising and organizing the content in documents on art history, and LIS knowledge organization systems. It is concluded that the UDC, in particular, is well suited for representation of knowledge produced in the contexts of pre-paradigmatic, iconological, and stylistic studies. But documents by the so-called New art scholars drawing on interdisciplinary studies and representing new approaches and paradigms break with the taxonomies on art in the classical hierarchical, universal classification systems. A step towards a solution of problems caused by this break is a polyhierarchical thesaurus such as the Art & Architecture Thesaurus."

The analysis resulted in a seven-facet subject classification. In the second phase the conceptual skeleton was elaborated, and adjusted to the field of social work by a grounded-theory methodology. The data used for grounding the model were 14 social work resources. The model was tested in the third phase by classifying 200 terms randomly selected from the Dictionary of Social Work (Barker, 1999).

The history and origin of bibliographic classification [Dewey, Bliss, Mills, Beghtol] are discussed from the perspective of pragmatist philosophy and social studies of science [Kuhn, Merton, Reica]. Choices of structural principles in different schemes are found to rely on more or less implicit philosophical foundations, ranging from rationalism to pragmatism. It is further shown how the increasing application of faceted structures as basic structural principles in universal classification schemes [DDC, UDC] impose rationalistic principles and structures for knowledge organization which are not in alignment with the development of knowledge in the covered disciplines. Further evidence of rationalism in knowledge organization is the fiction/non-fiction distinction, excluding the important role of artistic resources for, in particular, humanistic research. Finally, for the analysis of appropriate bibliographic unit, it is argued that there is a need to shift towards a semiotic approach, founded on an understanding of intertextuality, rather than applying standard principles of hierarchical decomposition of documents. It is concluded that a change in classification research is needed, founded on a more historical and social understanding of knowledge."

The most recent edition of DDC, with its enhanced features, has greater potential than other traditional approaches. A review of selected Web sites that use DDC to organize Web resources indicates, however, that the full potential of the DDC scheme for this purpose has not been realized. While the review found that the DDC classification structure was more effective when compared with other knowledge organization systems, we conclude that DDC needs to be further enhanced to make it more suitable for this application. As widely reported in the professional literature, OCLC has conducted research on the potential of DDC for organizing Web resources. Such research, however, is experimental and should be supplemented by empirical studies with user participation."

This is termed personalization of information. The main axe of our study is the how to personnalize the system's response according to the user's objective. We propose the use of a user model for personnailizing the system's response. In our approach, the user model defines what to represent for each user. The activities of the user during the use of an IRS is recorded based on the user model. The analysis and synthesis of these activities are used to provide the user with more relevant solutions according to his objective. Three different applications have been developed to validate our approach of personalizing the system?s response and based on an architecture that we defined for a cooperative information retrieval.

A critical analysis of classification schemes used in major portals and Web classified directories exposes inconsistencies in the way they classify Internet resources. The inconsistencies indicate that the developers fail to differentiate the various classificatory models, and are unaware of their different rationales. The study establishes eight classificatory models for resources available to Internet users. Internet resources can be classified by subjects, objects, applications, users, locations, reference sources, media, and languages. The first five models are content-related; namely they characterize the content of the resource. The other three models are format-related; namely they characterize the format of the resource or its technological infrastructure. The study identifies and formulates the eight classificatory models, analyzes their rationales, and discusses alternative ways to combine them in a faceted integrated classification scheme."

This distinction has relevance beyond Information Studies, particularly in relation to homosexual concerns. Literary criticism, in particular, frequently addresses the question: when is a work about homosexuality? This paper explores this literary debate and its implications for the design of subject access systems for gay and lesbian communities. By examining the literary criticism of Herman Melville's Billy Budd, particularly in relation to the theories of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick in The Epistemology of the Closet (1990), this paper exposes three tensions that designers of gay and lesbian classifications and vocabularies can expect to face. First is a tension between essentialist and constructivist views of homosexuality, which will affect the choice of terms, categories, and references. Second is a tension between minoritizing and universalizing perspectives on homosexuality. Third is a redefined distinction between aboutness and meaning, in which aboutness refers not to stable document content, but to the system designer's inescapable social and ideological perspectives. Designers of subject access systems can therefore expect to work in a context of intense scrutiny and persistent controversy"

Diametrically different opinions, seemingly corroborated through empirical evidence, have been presented since the time of the Cranfield experiments. Similar situations have often been encountered in the history of science if reasoning has exclusively been based on empiricism. In the information scientific field, several empirical laws have been formulated, for example that of the alledgedly inverse precision-recall relationship in information retrieval, of the assumed direct relationship between consistency and quality of indexing, and of the alledged equivalence of automatic with intellectual indexing. Empiricism is seen as only another variation of positivism, which has been abandoned in the natural sciences since the middle of this century for its evident inadequacy, but has latently survived in information science and even now dominates here. Here, it constitutes a source of continual confusion and an impediment to progress. For literally anything an empirical proof can be submitted provided that suitable examples are selected and methods are chosen. Substantial advance in Library and Information Science requires abandoning empiricism. Budd's hermeneutic phenomenology seems to constitute a promising substitute (1995)."

In this paper, the definition of the work as an entity for information retrieval is examined. A taxonomic definition (that is, a definition built around a taxonomy) is presented. An epistemological perspective aids in understanding the components of the taxonomic definition. Works, thus defined as entities for information retrieval, are seen to constitute sets of varying instantiations of abstract creations. These variant instantiations must be explicitly identified in future systems for documentary information retrieval. An expanded perception of works, such as that presented in this paper, helps us understand the variety of ways in which mechanisms for their control and retrieval might better be shaped in future."

The Genre and Activity of the Experimental Article in Science is written knowledge as it is produced by the academy. Bazerman discusses in particular the rhetoric, communicative, and epistemological issues of written knowledge. The article discusses these themes in a library and information science (LIS) perspective in terms of their implications for LIS research. For several reasons, it is argued that this way of scrutinizing into written knowledge ought to be of special interest to LIS research. As an example of a particular field of research in LIS, the article discusses the relationship between indexing theory and written knowledge. Bazerman analyzes written knowledge from a literary point of view. Among other things, it is argued that indexing theory can be seen as part of literary theory in that some of the questions raised by the latter are also raised in indexing theory. Furthermore, it is put forward that the indexer can be considered an author. The indexer produces a text, the document representation, which is the text the user actually meets in the first place. That way, the producer of a document representation is to some extent responsible for the quality of the documents indexed. Having discussed this relationship between written knowledge and LIS research in general and indexing theory in particular, it is concluded that LIS research ought to head toward more humanistic oriented research traditions, if the line of research presented by Bazerman should be considered useful for LIS."

This is a broad field that has not been covered appropriately in knowledge organization systems such as classification schemes, thesauri, and terminology databases. The objective of the project is to improve significantly the efficiency and the quality of cross-language and cross-cultural information exchange and knowledge discovery by facilitating concept mapping and information retrieval between Western and Eastern medical traditions. Major facets of the conceptual framework include Diagnostic Categories, Therapeutic Preparations, Human Anatomy, Selected Diseases/Medical Conditions, and Basics of Traditional Systems. The paper discusses issues of subject coverage, the representation of medical concepts in the conceptual framework, incorporation of concept names that have existed in individual traditional systems, and the relationships among concepts.

This holds true in particular in the case of general concepts and of their syntactical connectivity. Hence, natural language query phrasing and searching is an unending adventure of trial and error and, in most cases, has an unsatisfactory outcome with respect to the recall and precision ratios of the responses. Human indexing is based on knowledgeable document interpretation and aims - among other things - at introducing predictability into the representation of documents. Due to the indeterminacy of natural language text phrasing and image construction, any adequate indexing is also indeterminate in nature and therefore inherently defies any satisfactory algorithmization. But human indexing suffers from a different set of deficiencies which are absent in the processing of non-interpreted natural language. An optimally effective information system combines both types of language in such a manner that their specific strengths are preserved and their weaknesses are avoided. If the goal is a large and enduring information system for more than merely known-item searches, the expenditure for an advanced index language and its knowledgeable and careful employment is unavoidable."

The best efforts to achieve an arrangement char is helpful to users will be thwarted by the multifaceted nature of these items and the specific needs of the user and the library. Items on a particular subject will be scattered throughout the library building(s) across disciplines, by physical form, by frequency of use and whether and for how long they may be borrowed. Even though the rich information content of multifaceted items may be represented in the notation, the items required by a user will be scattered across library shelves when the item is placed in a single relative location. This paper explores these issues using examples from a University Library classified using the Dea ey Decimal Classification Scheme (DDC). The electronic context of the library OPAC can transcend the constraints imposed by the predominantly physical nature of library collections, yet the current use of classification schemes in on-line systems retains many of these limitations. Examples of such systems applying DDC on the World Wide Web are discussed and compared with a system that seeks to use DDC in what is called view-based searching. The interface and the resulting browsing and searching capability of a View-Based Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) are described. Ways in which subject. access to library collections can be improved and disciplinary scatter resolved by assigning multiple class numbers to items and exploiting the rich Dewey structure in a faceted form are discussed. It is suggested that the informative power of visual classificatory structures at the search interface will be beneficial to the broader learning experience of the user. The paper concludes that the application of classification schemes in electronic interfaces should not be bound by the physical constraints that no longer apply in an electronic context but be exploited to provide a complete, flexible and individual interface as determined by the needs of each user."

A key challenge in work centered design of classification schemes is the evolving semantics of work. This article introduces a work centered approach to the design of classification schemes, based on the framework of cognitive work analysis. We launch collaborative task situations as a new unit of analysis for capturing evolving semantic structures in work domains. An example case from a cognitive work analysis of three national film research archives illustrates the application of the framework for identifying actors' needs for a classification scheme to support collaborative knowledge integration. It is concluded that a main contribution of the new approach is support for empirical analysis and overall design of classification schemes that can serve as material interfaces for actors' negotiations and integration of knowledge perspectives during collaborative work."

One of the major contributions in this area of personalization of the system's response is by taking into consideration each user's specificity. We propose the use of explicit user model where the system's solution will be determined by the knowledge of the user. The user's activities are recorded as documents. The method we adopt for information retrieval combines query by criteria and information analysis. We have also proposed architecture for cooperative information retrieval. This architecture allows two users to share their experience in the process information retrieval and for the interpretation of the system's result, on distant machines. The proposals were implemented in two systems: STREEMS and METIORE. STREEMS manages information on trees while METIORE manages information on bibliographic references."

The majority of methods proposing evaluation metrics (bibliometrics and scientometrics studies) for STW rely solely on statistical data analysis methods (co-citation analysis, co-word analysis). Such methods usually work on structured databases where the units of analysis (words, keywords) are already attributed to documents by human indexers. The advent of huge amounts of unstructured textual data has rendered necessary the integration of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to first extract meaningful units from texts. We propose a method for STW which is NLP-oriented. The method not only analyses texts linguistically in order to extract terms from them, but also uses linguistic relations (syntactic variations) as the basis for clustering. Terms and variation relations are formalised as weighted di-graphs which the clustering algorithm, CPCL (Classification by Preferential Clustered Link) will seek to reduce in order to produce classes. These classes ideally represent the research topics present in the corpus. The results of the classification are subjected to validation by an expert in STW."

(2) Inside LIS there have been many different approaches and traditions of KO with little mutual influence. These traditions have to a large extent been defined by new technology, for which reason the theoretical integration and underpinning has not been well considered. The most important technology-driven traditions are: a) Manual indexing and classification in libraries and reference works, b) Documentation and scientific communication, c) Information storage and retrieval by computers, d) Citation based KO and e) Full text, hypertext and Internet based approaches. These traditions taken together define very much the special LIS focus on KO. For KO as a field of research it is important to establish a fruitful theoretical frame of reference for this overall field. This paper provides some suggestions. (3) One important, theoretical distinction to consider is the one between social and intellectual forms of KO. Social forms of KO are related to professional training, disciplines and social groups while intellectual organization is related to concepts and theories in the fields to be organized. (4) The social perspective includes in addition the systems of genres and documents as well as the social system of knowledge producers, knowledge intermediaries and knowledge users. (5) This social system of documents, genres and agents makes available a very complicated structure of potential subject access points (SAPs), which may be used in information retrieval (IR). The basic aim of research in KO is to develop knowledge on how to optimise this system of SAPs and its utilization in IR. (6) SAPs may be seen as signs, and their production and use may be understood from a social semiotic point of view. (7) The concept of paradigms is also helpful because different groups and interests tend to be organized according to a paradigm and to develop different criteria of relevance, and thus different criteria of likeliness in KO. (8) The basic unit in KO is the semantic relation between two concepts, and such relations are embedded in theories. (9) In classification like things are grouped together, but what is considered similar is not a trivial question. (10) The paper concludes with the considering of methods for KO. Basically the methods of any field are connected with epistemological theories. This is also the case with KO. The existing methods as described in the literature of KO fit into a classification of basic epistemological views. The debate about the methods of KO at the deepest level therefore implies an epistemological discussion."

Class number alone is not able to uniquely indivdiualise a document on the library shelves. The function of a book number starts from where that of the class number ends. An author number also brings together all the books by one author in one specific subject. A chronological book number will clearly portray the development of a subject over a given period. Book numbers are indispensable for a shelflist. The National Library (NL) of India at Kolkata has a collection of about 3 million documents. For organizing its contents it uses the DDC and the shelf arrangement is by Cutter's three figure author table. For Indian names it uses its home-made author table described here. Though the National Library table is designed especially for Indian names across all religions and regional cultures, yet its use outside the National Library has not been reported mostly due lack of marketing. Since 1961 the Indian cultural names have undergone many changes. The need is to revise and update the table to reflect the current culture and new authors across India."

How this is done in practice and the patterns to be found are the focus of this article. The empirical basis is the collection of 76,601 different keywords with a total frequency of 178,215 from 500 randomly chosen taggers on del.icio.us. at the end of 2005. The keywords collected were then analyzed quantitatively statistically by uncovering their frequency and percentage distribution and through a statistical correspondence analysis in order to uncover possible patterns in the users' tags. Subsequently, a qualitative textual analysis of the tags was made in order to find out by analysis which tagging strategies are represented in the data material. This led to four conclusions. 1) the distribution of keywords follows classic power law; 2) distinct tagging communities are identifiable; 3) the most frequently used tags are situated on a general-specific axis; and 4) nine distinct tagging strategies are observed. These four conclusions are put into perspective collectively in respect of a number of more general and theoretical considerations concerning folksonomies and the classification systems of the future."

The authors analyze three weblogs (Biblioatipici, Letture and Andrea Marchitelli’s blog) to demonstrate that different contents may be classified using the appropriate scheme.; Biblioatipici is a weblog about temporary workers in libraries and Italian documentation centres, indexed with a faceted scheme, home made by authors. Letture, a diary about reading and books, is indexed by DDC; finally, Andrea Marchitelli’s blog, a weblog about digital libraries and open access, is indexed by JITA, the scheme used for indexing e-prints in some different open archives.; The three applications are presented starting from the most complex scheme (i.e. the faceted one) to the simple but least functional (JITA), passing through a traditional bibliographic classification scheme, the Dewey Decimal Classification.; The analysis demonstrates that different web contents can efficiently be classified with different schemes. In particular, with the facets one (Biblioatipici) the indexer is able to generate the needed classes in the indexing phase. Moreover with a small number of facets and foci one can obtain an exponential number of classes. Finally, one of the advantages for the user is that the faceted scheme allows multiple accesses on the basis of different information requirements, in addition to being coherent and intuitive. DDC scheme can be more suitable than the first web pages or blogs performing a sort of digital library. In this case in fact the DDC scheme constitutes a consolidated classification standard, widespread in a huge quantity of libraries and the use of a different scheme might get confusion. JITA scheme, finally, can find a huge applicability in web pages (or blogs) in LIS field showing several advantages: it’s very simple and essentialy pragmatic, intuitive and coherent. It’s a conservative scheme because structurally closed, in fact it does not allow the classifier to insert new LCS’s categories. If, from a certain point of view, this is a disadvantage, vice versa this feature is really useful because get a complete matching between classes of all the web pages implemented with it."

The following question is considered: Could Repertory Grid technique be used as a tool in the creation of metadata? It is postulated that repertory grid technique may be used as a tool for creating metadata labels, or tags, where the labels or tags describe entities, which may be images, documents or expressions. Repertory grid technique can provide a method for examining the detail about an individual's mental models, or personal construct systems of lifeworld entities, which may include images, documents or expressions. The question were considered by looking at the results of an earlier study, which explored the personal constructs of systems analysts using the repertory grid technique to examine the mental conceptualizations that determine the extent of difference in conceptualization. Categorical core areas of expressions used during software requirements development emerge through classification of the conceptualizations of expressions elicited via the repertory grid interviews. Repertory grid also reveals, through cluster analysis, the subtle difference in the way each participant conceptually related one expression to another expression. The differences in conceptual relationship of expressions or concepts could represent insight about how people view entities of a lifeworld. In a situation where metadata are used to label entities of a lifeworld for organization and retrieval of information, the differences in conceptual relationships might influence the metadata created and how they are used in the lifeworld for the organization and retrieval of information."

Determining the extent to which such an objective is achieved is the focus of what is known as a knowledge audit. In this practice-oriented article, the authors review the fundamentals of creating a taxonomy, the use of meta-data in a necessary process known as classification and the role of expertise locators where the knowledge is not explicit but resides within experts in the form of tacit knowledge. The authors conclude with a framework for developing a corporate taxonomy and how such a project may be executed. The conceptual contribution of this article is the postulation that corporate taxonomies that are designed to facilitate knowledge audits lead to greater organizational impact."

The latter include eliminating ambiguity, controlling synonyms or equivalents, establishing explicit semantic relationships such as hierarchical and associative relationships, and presenting both relationships and properties of concepts in the knowledge models. Examples of KOS include lists, authority files, gazetteers, synonym rings, taxonomies and classification schemes, thesauri, and ontologies. These systems model the underlying semantic structure of a domain and provide semantics, navigation, and translation through labels, definitions, typing, relationships, and properties for concepts. The term knowledge organization systems (KOS) is intended to encompass all types of schemes for organizing information and promoting knowledge management, such as classification schemes, gazetteers, lexical databases, taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies (Hodge 2000). These systems model the underlying semantic structure of a domain and provide semantics, navigation, and translation through labels, definitions, typing, relationships, and properties for concepts (Hill et al. 2002, Koch and Tudhope 2004). Embodied as (Web) services, they facilitate resource discovery and retrieval by acting as semantic road maps, thereby making possible a common orientation for indexers and future users, either human or machine (Koch and Tudhope 2003, 2004)."

The role of classification schemes as information institutions in their own right is established, and the Dewey Decimal Classification is introduced as the case to be studied. The challenges faced by classification-scheme designers in the construction and/or reconstruction of race-related categories are reviewed; and an analysis is presented of one sense in which it might be suggested that recent (2003) revisions in one of the DDC’s tables appear not to meet those challenges wholly successfully. An account is given of a further sense in which adoption of a critical race-theoretic approach has the more radical effect of calling into question a fundamental decision recently taken to “deracialize” the DDC.

There were in total, nine quality controlled SGs that were functional for shorter or longer periods of time. Their typology and functionality is described. Quality SGs have evolved and the role of classification has changed accordingly from supporting subject organization on the interface and automatic categorization of resources, towards supporting a semantic linking, control and vocabulary mapping between different indexing systems in subject hubs and federated SGs. In this period, many SGs ceased to exist and little information remains available regarding their status. SGs currently using UDC, for some part of their resource organization, do not use a UDC subject hierarchy at the interface and its role in resource indexing has become more difficult to observe. Since 2000, UDC has become more prevalent in East European SGs, portals and hubs, which are outside the scope of this research. This paper is an attempt to provide a record on this particular application of UDC and to offer some consideration of the changes in requirements when it comes to the use of library classification in resource discovery."

The integration of knowledge would seem to constitute a quality indicator present in most proposals, and it also responds to the need for KOS with frameworks comprehensible for all user sectors, respecting the diversity of users. The flip side of knowledge integration entails the conjugation of technical, formal and technological aspects, well represented by the word interoperability, or the search for a way to simplify and harmonize the great variety of structures and formats that coexist in the Internet. This paper addresses the aforementioned major research concerns expressed in the last decade of KO literature. It is structured into two broad sections: 1) A demand for quality, touching on research questions related to multilingualism, cross-culturalism, social groups, minorities and ethics, as well as the integration of structures, forms and formats and the respective proposals by scholars; and 2) A demand for managing emergent knowledge in KOS, with a discussion of how to represent and organize work-oriented and organizational knowledge domains, where multidimensional knowledge (multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinarity) is addressed together with the responses put forth by various researchers."

While the MARC format allows the recording of most bibliographic relationships, many of them are not expressed systematically. Conceptual content relationships include, in turn, interconcept and intraconcept relationships. The expression of interconcept relationships is covered by standard thesaural relationships, which typically do not distinguish fully between the underlying lexical relationship types. The full expression of complex intraconcept relationships includes indication of the basic nature of the relationship (including a set of semantic roles), the set of entities that participate in the relationship, and a mapping between participants and semantic roles. Knowledge organization schemes seldom express these relationships fully."

Folksonomy-based systems allow users to classify web resources through tagging bookmarks, photos or other web resources and saving them to a public web site like Del.icio.us. Thus information about web resources and online articles can be shared in an easy way. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the folksonomy tagging phenomenon (also called social tagging and social bookmarking) and explore some of the reasons why we need controlled vocabularies, discussing the problems associated with folksonomy."

It consists of different kinds of semantic relationships, with the aim of guiding users to the choice of the most suitable index and search terms for expressing a certain concept. The relational semantics of a thesaurus deal with methods to connect terms with related meanings and are intended to enhance information recall capabilities. In this paper, focused on hierarchical relations, different aspects of the relational semantics of thesauri, and among them the possibility of developing richer structures, are analyzed. Thesauri are viewed as semantic tools providing, for operational purposes, the representation of the meaning of the terms. The paper stresses how theories of semantics, holding different perspectives about the nature of meaning and how it is represented, affect the design of the relational semantics of thesauri. The need for tools capable of representing the complexity of knowledge and of the semantics of terms as it occurs in the literature of their respective subject fields is advocated. It is underlined how this would contribute to improving the retrieval of information. To achieve this goal, even though in a preliminary manner, we explore the possibility of setting against the framework of thesaurus design the notions of language games and hermeneutic horizon."

Two distinct professional communities have been involved in the research, both pertaining to the Local Health Units in Tuscany. One community is made up of head physicians and health care managers whilst the other is formed by technical staff from the Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene. It emerged from the experimentation that concept maps are considered more effective in analyzing knowledge domain related to the problem to be faced (description of what it is). On the other hand, Petri Nets are more effective in studying and formalizing its possible solutions (description of what to do to). For the same reason, those involved in the experimentation have proposed the complementary rather than alternative use of the two knowledge representation methods as a support for professional problem-solving."

We briefly introduce the beginning and principles of folksonomy and discuss the categorizing concept of folksonomies on the basis of the computer program delicious. The selection of the metadata tagged is not accidental, rather tagging follows a pattern that proves to be the pattern for the classic power law, which, in many complex systems is seen to unfold as an imitation-dynamic that creates an asymmetry, where a few descriptive metadata are often reproduced and the majority seldom reproduced. In del.icio.us, it is the very broadband basic subject headings that are often reproduced and achieve power in the system - which in cognitive psychology is called cognitive basic categories - while the small, more specific subject headings are seldom reproduced. The law of power's underlying imitation-dynamic in del.icio.us is explained from the perspective of different theoretical paradigms, i.e. network, economy and cognition. The theorectical and speculative conclusion is that the law of power and asymmetry is biased by a cognitive economizing through a simplification principle in the users' construction of descriptive metadata. Free tagging in folksonomies is comparable to empirical experiments in free categorization. Users often choose broad basic categories, because that requires the least cognitive effort. The consequences are that folksonomy is not necessarily a better, more realistic and cheaper method of creating metadata than that which can be generated through taxonomies, faceted classification or search algorithms. Folksonomy as a self-organizing system likely cannot create better and cheaper descriptive metadata."

While the design and construction of controlled vo-cabularies have been prescribed at the technical level in great detail over the past decades, the methodological level has been somewhat neglected. However, classification research has in recent years focused on developing approaches to the analysis of users, domains, and activities that could produce requirements for the design of controlled vocabularies. Researchers have of-ten argued that the design, construction, and use of controlled vocabularies need to be based on analyses and understandings of the contexts in which these controlled vocabularies function. While one would assume that the growing body of research on human information behavior might help guide the development of controlled vocabularies shed light on these contexts, unfor-tunately, much of the research in this area is descriptive in nature and of little use for systems design. This paper discusses these trends and outlines a holistic approach that demonstrates how the design of controlled vocabularies can be informed by inves-tigations of people’s interactions with information. This approach is based on the Cognitive Work Analysis framework and outlines several dimensions of human-information interactions. Application of this approach will result is a comprehensive un-derstanding of the contexts in which the controlled vocabulary will function and which can be used for the development of for the development of controlled vocabularies."

An approach being discussed considers the intrinsic semantics of texts of documents. Based on the hypothesis that noun phrases in a text are semantically rich in terms of their ability to represent the subject content of the document, this approach seeks to identify and extract noun phrases instead of single keywords, and use them as descriptors.

The concept""learner's glossary' is delimited among other types of terminological collections such as a specialised dictionary, a thesaurus and a term bank in Section 2 where the information categories in an entry are specified (keyterm plus translation equivalent(s), definition of keyterm and exemplary context, narrower terms with synonyms, definitions and translation equivalents; special phrases based on keyterm collocations with translation equivalents and exemplary contexts). Section 3 describes the principles and working methods of modern terminography as well as the source materials available for the glossary compilation. A hybrid term extraction technique is also described in that section and is used to extract the candidate terms with subsequent manual initial processing of the results. In Section 4 the theoretical grounds and methodology for analysing the conceptual relations in a terminological system are presented including the expert validation of the automatically extracted terms as a first phase in that process. Rationale for applying a lexico-semantic analysis in identifying collocational information on the keyterms is provided in Section 5 which is proposed to involve descriptions of the actantial structure of a keyterm for identifying verbal (T+v) collocations and of the paradigmatic and syntagmatic morpho-syntactic relations applicable to a keyterm.

This study used a flow map method to identify learner's ""core"" and ""anchored"" concepts derived from the treatment instruction about thermal physics. The results showed that with the assistance of ""core"" concept, profitably mediated by the ""anchored"" concept, learners could recall more extended knowledge, with greater richness and with higher connection than in the absence of this organizing information (Experiment 1). However, the difference between the provision of a group core concept and an individual core concept did not reach any significance level in the recall task two-month later (Experiment 2). When the recall task was carried out six months later, the group ""anchored"" concept showed the essential assistance to the recall of knowledge (Experiment 3).

Each of these approaches tends to answer the question: ""What is knowledge organization?"" differently. LIS professionals have often concentrated on applying new technology and standards, and may not have seen their work as involving interpretation and analysis of meaning. That is why library classification has been criticized for a lack of substantive intellectual content.

Subjects attached to records representing cited works are compared to subjects attached to records representing the original citing sources, and to the subjects yielded by chasing see-also references from the latter group of headings. Original citing sources were yielded via a subject-list search in a library catalog using the subject heading ""Language and languages - Origin."" A subject-search was employed to avoid subjectivity in choosing sources. References from the sources were searched in OCLC where applicable, and the subject headings were retrieved. The subjects were ranked first by number of citations from original sources, then by total citation-frequency. The results were tiered into four groups in a Bradford-like distribution. A similar rank and division was performed on the subjects representing the original citing sources, and those yielded by chasing see-also references. Both in terms of subject frequency and topic type, positive comparisons between citation-chasing and see-also references show a confirmation of different methods of yielding alternative subjects. Exclusive results suggest potential mutual complementary value among these different methods."

Several philosophers in time have pointed out that reality is structured into a series of integrative levels, like the physical, the biological, the mental, and the cultural, and that each level plays as a base for the emergence of more complex levels. More detailed theories of levels have been developed by Nicolai Hartmann and James K. Feibleman, and these have been considered as a source for structuring principles in bibliographic classification by both the Classification Research Group (CRG) and Ingetraut Dahlberg. CRG's analysis of levels and of their possible application to a new general classification scheme based on phenomena instead of disciplines, as it was formulated by Derek Austin in 1969, is examined in detail. Both benefits and open problems in applying integrative levels to bibliographic classification are pointed out."

Therefore, a definition of the concept of Representation of knowledge is indispensable. The term representation has been used in western cultural and intellectual tradition to refer to the diverse ways that a subject comprehends an object. Representation is a process which requires the structure of natural language and human memory whereby it is interwoven in a subject and in conscience. However, at the present time, the term Representation of knowledge is applied to the processing of electronic information, combined with the aim of emulating the human mind in such a way that one has endeavoured to transfer, with great difficulty, the complex structurality of the conceptual representation of human knowledge to new digital information technologies. Thus, nowadays, representation of knowledge has taken on diverse meanings and it has focussed, for the moment, on certain structures and conceptual hierarchies which carry and transfer information, and has initially been based on the current representation of knowledge using artificial intelligence. The traditional languages of documentation, also referred to as languages of representation, offer a structured representation of conceptual fields, symbols and terms of natural and notational language, and they are the pillars for the necessary correspondence between the object or text and its representation. These correspondences, connections and symbolisations will be established within the electronic framework by means of different models and of the goal domain, which will give rise to organisations, structures, maps, networks and levels, as new electronic documents are not compact units but segments of information. Thus, the new representation of knowledge refers to data, images, figures and symbolised, treated, processed and structured ideas which replace or refer to documents within the framework of technical processing and the recuperation of electronic information."

For this, a randomly collected sample of 659 metadata item records from three digital image collections is analyzed. Implications and issues drawn from the evaluation of the current status of metadata creation and mapping are also discussed in relation to the issue of semantic interoperability of concept representation across digital image collections. The findings of the study suggest that conceptual ambiguities and semantic overlaps inherent among some DC metadata elements hinder semantic interoperability. The DC metadata scheme needs to be refined in order to disambiguate semantic relations of certain DC metadata elements that present semantic overlaps and conceptual ambiguities between element names and their corresponding definitions. The findings of the study also suggest that the development of mediation mechanisms such as concept networks that facilitate the metadata creation and mapping process are critically needed for enhancing metadata quality."

NAICS is considered a rational system that uses the underlying economic principle of similar production processes as the basis for its classes. For the Information Sector of the economy, as formulated in NAICS, a key production process is the acquisition and defense of copyright. With open source, copyleft licensing eliminates copyright acquisition and protection as major production processes, suggesting that the open source software industry warrants a separate NAICS category. More importantly, our analysis suggests that NAICS cannot be understood as a taxonomy of objective economic activity but is instead a politically and historically contingent system of data classification."

Conclusions are drawn that the reasons for rejection of the DDC not only is to be sought in theoretical or even practical problems regarding the system itself but in the academic library sector which, through the SAB-system, could create a lasting influence on the knowledge organisation in public libraries in order to uphold the national identity of the Swedish library system"

In this research, since the scope of data analysis focuses on tags assigned to web documents, consideration on Manifestation and Item has been excluded. Accordingly, only the attributes of Work and Expression entity were investigated in order to map the attributes of tags to attributes defined in those entities. The content analysis on tag attributes was conducted on a total of 113 web documents regarding 11 attribute categories defined by FRBR. The findings identified essential bibliographic attributes of tags and tagging behaviors by subject. The findings showed that concerning specific subject areas, taggers exhibited different tagging behaviors representing distinctive features and tendencies.

Gnoli, Claudio. Classification Transcends Library Business. Knowledge Organization, 37(3), 223-229. 26 references. Abstract: Although bibliographic classifications usually adopt a perspective different from that of object classifications, the two have obvious relationships. These become especially relevant when users are looking for knowledge scattered in a wide va- riety of forms and media. This is an increasingly common situation, as library catalogues now coexist in the global digital envi- ronment with catalogues of archives, of museums, of commercial products, and many other information resources. In order to make the subject content of all these resources searchable, a broader conception of classification is needed, that can be applied to any knowledge item, rather than only bibliographic materials. To illustrate this we take an example of the research on bag- pipes in Northern Italian folklore. For this kind of research, the most effective search strategy is a cross-media one, looking for many different knowledge sources such as published documents, police archives, painting details, museum specimens, organi- zations devoted to related subjects. To provide satisfying results for this kind of search, the traditional disciplinary approach to classification is not sufficient. Tools are needed in which knowledge items dealing with a phenomenon of interest can be re- trieved independently from the other topics with which it is combined, the disciplinary context, and the medium where it oc- curs. This can be made possible if the basic units of classification are taken to be the phenomena treated, as recommended in the Leon Manifesto, rather than disciplines or other aspect features. The concept of bagpipes should be retrievable and browsable in any combination with other phenomena, disciplines, media etc. Examples are given of information sources that could be managed by this freely-faceted technique of classification."

Contextualism maintains that knowledge is not available in a neutral and objective way, but is always interwoven with the process of knowledge production and the prerequisites of the knower. As a first step towards a systematic organization of epistemic contexts, the concept of knowledge will be considered in its onto- logical (WHAT) and epistemological (WHO) including methodological (HOW) dimensions. In current KO research, however, either the contextualism is not fully implemented (classification-as-ontology) or the ambition for a context-transcending universal KOS seems to have been abandoned (classification-as-epistemology). Based on a combined ontology and epistemology it will be argued that a phenom- ena-based approach to KO as stipulated by the Leon Manifesto, for example, requires a revision of the underlying phenomenon concept as a relation between the known object (WHAT) and the knowing subject (WHO), which is constituted by the application of specific meth- ods (HOW). While traditional subject indexing of documents often relies on the organizing principle ""levels of being"" (WHAT), for a fu- ture context indexing, two novel principles are proposed, namely ""levels of knowing"" (WHO) and ""integral methodological pluralism"" (HOW)."

Key headings form a vital part of the system of coining new headings. It is proposed that more key headings should be designated. Some candidate headings are described. One far-reaching provision seems to be the use of a subdivision of a preferred heading with all of its NTs. Thus, every preferred heading is a potential key heading for all of its NTs. This proposal works on the principle that what is true of a class is true of its narrower classes of all types. Applying this principle will enormously enhance the capacity of the List without adding even an iota to its text and size."

Similarly, is it ethical for archivists to detach digital items from their archival context in order to make them more ""digital friendly"" and more accessible to meet needs of some users?

Folksonomies consisting of subject designators (tags) assigned by users, however, have one important drawback: they do not express semantic relationships either hierarchical or associative between tags. As a consequence, the use of tags to browse information resources requires moving from one resource to another, based on coincidence and not on the pre-established meaningful or logical connections that may exist between related resources. We suggest that the semantic structure of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) may be used in complementing and supporting tag-based browsing. In this work, two specific questions were investigated: (1) Are terms used as tags in folksonomies included in the UDC? and (2) Which facets of UDC match the characteristics of documents or information objects that are tagged in folksonomies? A collection of the most popular tags from Amazon, LibraryThing, Delicious and 43Things was investigated. The universal nature of UDC was examined through the universality of topics and facets covering diverse human interests which are at the same time interconnected and form a rich and intricate semantic structure.

Gnoli, Claudio. Metadata About What? Distinguishing Between Ontic, Epistemic, and Documental Dimensions in Knowledge Organization. Knowledge Organization. 39(4), 268-275. 37 references. ABSTRACT: The spread of many new media and formats is changing the scenario faced by knowledge organizers: as printed monographs are not the only standard form of knowledge carrier anymore, the traditional kind of knowl- edge organization (KO) systems based on academic disciplines is put into question. A sounder foundation can be provided by an analysis of the different dimensions concurring to form the content of any knowledge item—what Brian Vickery described as the steps ""from the world to the classifier."" The ultimate referents of documents are the phenomena of the real world, that can be ordered by ontology, the study of what exists. Phenomena coexist in subjects with the perspectives by which they are considered, pertaining to epistemology, and with the formal features of knowledge carriers, adding a further, pragmatic layer. All these di- mensions can be accounted for in metadata, but are often done so in mixed ways, making indexes less rigorous and interoperable. For example, while facet analysis was originally developed for subject indexing, many ""faceted"" interfaces today mix subject fac- ets with form facets, and schemes presented as ""ontologies"" for the ""semantic Web"" also code for non-semantic information. In bibliographic classifications, phenomena are often confused with the disciplines dealing with them, the latter being assumed to be the most useful starting point, for users will have either one or another perspective. A general citation order of dimensions— phenomena, perspective, carrier—is recommended, helping to concentrate most relevant information at the beginning of head- ings."

The model of scale-free networks, which has been recently developed and widely applied since, can be effectively used in terminology research as well. Operation based on the principle of networks is a universal characteristic of complex systems. Networks are governed by general laws. The model of scale-free networks can be viewed as a statistical-probability model, and it can be described with mathematical tools. Its main feature is that ‘everything is connected to everything else’, that is every node is reachable (in a few steps) starting from any other node; this phenomena called ‘the small world phenomenon’. The existence of a linguistic network and the general laws of the operation of networks enable us to place issues of language use in the complex system of relations that reveal the deeper connections between phenomena with the help of networks embedded in each other. The realization of the metaphor that language also has a network structure is the basis of the classification methods of the terminological system, and likewise of the ways of creating terminology databases, which serve the purpose of providing easy and versatile accessibility to specialised knowledge."

One of the motivators of such an appropriation is the vision of the Semantic Web, a set of developments underway, which might allow one to obtain better results when querying on the web. However, it is worth asking what kind of semantics we can find in the Semantic Web, considering that studying the subject is a complex and controversial endeavour. Working within this context, we present an account of semantics relying on the main linguist approaches, in order to then analyze what semantics is within the scope of information technology. We critically evaluate a spectrum, which proposes the ordination of instruments (models, languages, taxonomic structures, to mention but a few) according to a semantic scale. In addition to proposing a new extended spectrum, the article suggests alternative interpretations with the aim of clarifying the use of the term “semantics” in different contexts. Finally, we offer our conclusions regarding the semantic in the Semantic Web and mention future directions and complementary works."

In output, the extracted knowledge is organized as network modeling dependencies between terms, which can be exploited to infer semantic relations.We test our approach on three specific domain corpora. The goal of this evaluation is to check if our model for organizing and exploiting contextual knowledge will improve the accuracy of extraction of simple and compound nouns. We also investigate the role of compound nouns in improving information retrieval results."

Objects and their descriptions and relations are not just “given” but determined by theories. Knowledge is fallible and consensus is rare. By implication, knowledge organization has to consider different theories/views and their foundations. Bibliographical classifications depend on subject knowledge and on the same theories as corresponding scientific and scholarly classifications. Some classifications are based on logical distinctions, others on empirical examinations, and some on mappings of common ancestors or on establishing functional criteria. To evaluate a classification is to involve oneself in the research which has produced the given classification. Because research is always based more or less on specific epistemological ideals (e.g. empiricism, rationalism, historicism or pragmatism), the evaluation of classification includes the evaluation of the epistemological foundations of the research on which given classifications have been based. The field of knowledge organization itself is based on different approaches and traditions such as user-based and cognitive views, facet-analytical views, numeric taxonomic approaches, bibliometrics and domain-analytic approaches. These approaches and traditions are again connected to epistemological views, which have to be considered. Only the domain-analytic view is fully committed to exploring knowledge organization in the light of subject knowledge and substantial scholarly theories."

Instead, the weight of social discipline among members of sexual subcultures themselves helps to create these classifications, often reflecting the nomenclature of subjects and desires within sexual subcultures in a complex relationship to a dominant culture. Critically examining two benchmarks in the development of sexual nomenclature within queer subcultures, this paper finds its evidence in George Chauncey's little known analysis (1985) of a navy investigation of male homosexuality at the Newport Naval Training Station during the World War I era and in contemporary folksonomic classifi- cations of representations of queer desire within Xtube, a database of online pornography. Social discipline within these sexual sub- cultures occurs in the stabilization of nomenclature through socialization and through members' overt intervention into each oth- ers' self-understanding. Both the Newport and Xtube evidence also reveals a complex social and cultural structure among members of sexual subcultures by drawing our attention to the particularity of various modes of sexual being and the relationship between those modes and particular configurations of sexual identity. In the process, this paper allows us to reassess, first, a presupposition of folksonomies as free of discipline allowing for their emancipatory potential and, second, the prevailing binary understandings of authority in the development of sexual nomenclatures and classifications as either top-down or bottom-up."

ABSTRACT: While the organization and representation of information and knowledge have historically been done by profes- sionals, the rise of social media has spread the notion that this can be done more collaboratively. A more collaborative approach would entail a change in the role of professionals and in the goals and values of the systems. This paper explores the notion of authority and the role of professionals in a changing environment where more people participate in the organization and repre- sentation of information and knowledge. The paper questions the traditional role of the professionals and argues that systems must be designed to facilitate trust and authority, and that the authority of folksonomies and systems comes from the users' collective interpretations and meaning production."

Biology has really become an information science; and, as such, it is also inspiring new ways of thinking and new kinds of knowledge paradigms beyond those discussed during past decades. In this regard, a new ""bioinformational"" approach to the inter-multi-disciplinary relationships among the sciences will be proposed herein: scientomics. Biologically inspired, scientomics contemplates the multifarious interactions between scientific disciplines from the ""knowledge recombination"" vantage point. In their historical expansion, the sciences would have recapitulated upon collective cognitive dynamics already realized along the evolutionary expansion of living systems, mostly by means of domain recombination processes within cellular genomes, but also occurring neurally inside the ""cerebral workspace"" of human brains and advanced mammals. Scientomics, understood as a new research field in the domain of knowledge organization, would capture the ongoing processes of scientific expansion and recombination by means of genomic inspired software (like in the new field of culturomics). It would explain the peculiar interaction maps of the sciences (scientometrics) as well as the increasing complexity of research amidst scientific and technological cumulative achievements. Beyond the polarized classical positions of reductionism and holism, scientomics could also propose new conceptual tools for scientific integration and planning, and for research management."

Many compound classes have been removed from the main tables, and more radical revisions of classes (particularly those for Medicine and Religion) have introduced a rigorous analysis, a clearer sense of citation order, and building of compound classes according to a more logical system syntax. The faceted approach provides a means of formalizing the relationships in the classification and making them explicit for machine recognition. In the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (BC2) (which has been a source for both UDC classes mentioned above), terminologies are encoded for automatic generation of hierarchical and associative relationships. Nevertheless, difficulties are encountered in vocabulary control, and a similar phenomenon is observed in UDC. Current work has revealed differences in the vocabulary of humanities and science, notably the way in which terms in the humanities should be handled when these are semantically complex. Achieving a balance between rigour in the structure of the classification and the complexity of natural language expression remains partially unresolved at present, but provides a fertile field for further research."

It is theorized that the compiler of the catalog, Liu Xin, used ru classicism, or Confucianism, as the principle for guiding the construction of three sets of ranked dichotomies that manifested into the six main classes in the set sequence. As a result, he successfully achieved the chief goal he intended for the catalog—to proclaim classicism as the intellectual authority. This design made the catalog, and its numerous successors in imperial China for two thousand years, an effective aid for intellectual, political, and social control."

In parallel, within the Artificial Intelligence and Semantic Web communities, Knowledge Representation (KR), has developed very powerful end expressive techniques which, via the use of ontologies, support queries by any entity property (e.g., the properties of the entities described in a document). However, KR has not scaled yet to the level of KO, mainly because of the lack of a precise and scalable entity specification methodology.

Five judges identified examples of strong/hesitant forward-looking sentiment that were used to compare the KOS developed in the study to existing models. The 'composite' KOS was subsequently applied to annual company reports to generate word frequency and biologically inspired diversity ratios. Critical realism was used as a philosophy to interpret word patterns. Results indicate the composite KOS improved on existing models identified in the literature for strong forward-looking sentiment. In one company, a statistically significant association was found between increasing diversity of assertive forward-looking sentiment and subsequent declining relative business performance. This supported the Pollyanna effect: the social phenomena of over-positive business language in that company. Sharp increases in mentions of the 'future' and 'learnings' were discovered in another company which may be explained by an industrial disaster and subsequent crisis management rhetoric, supporting discourse of renewal theory. This study shows that improvements can be made to existing KOS used to detect forward-looking sentiment in reports. Adopting critical realism as a philosophy when analysing 'big data' may lead to improved theory generation and the potential for differentiating insights."

We confront the current debates within the KO community about the relevance of universal bibliographic classifications and the thesaurus in the web with the ongoing discussions about the epistemological and methodological assumptions underlying data-driven inquiry. In essence, Big Data will not remove the need for humanly-constructed KOSs. However, ongoing transformations in knowledge production processes entailed by Big Data and web 2.0 put pressure on the KO community to rethink the standpoint from which KOSs are designed. Essentially, the field of KO needs to move from laying down the apodictic (that which we know for all time) to adapting to the new world of social and natural scientific knowledge by creating maximally flexible schemas – faceted rather than Aristotelean classifications. KO also needs to adapt to the changing nature of output in the social and natural sciences, to the extent that these in turn are being affected by the advent of Big Data. Theoretically, this entails a shift from purely universalist and normative top-down approaches to more descriptive bottom-up approaches that can be inclusive of diverse viewpoints. Methodologically, this means striking the right balance between two seemingly opposing modalities in designing KOSs: the necessity on the one hand to incorporate automated techniques and on the other, to solicit contributions from amateurs (crowdsourcing) via Web 2.0 platforms."

These large image collections need to be properly stored, organized and easily retrieved. Tags have a key role in image retrieval but it is difficult for those who upload the images to also undertake the quality tag assignment for potential future retrieval by others. Relying on professional keyword assignment is not a practical option for large image collections due to resource constraints. Although a number of content-based image retrieval systems have been launched, they have not demonstrated sufficient utility on large-scale image sources on the web, and are usually used as a supplement to existing text-based image retrieval systems. An alternative to professional image indexing can be social tagging -- with two major types being photo-sharing networks and image labeling games. Here we analyze these applications to evaluate their usefulness from the semantic point of view. We also investigate whether social tagging behaviour can be managed. The findings of the study have shown that social tagging can generate a sizeable number of tags that can be classified as interpretive for an image, and that tagging behaviour has a manageable and adjustable nature depending on tagging guidelines."

UPON Methontology of development ontologies was followed to create OTO ontology, and was implemented by using Protege-OWL. Accuracy of OTO ontology was assessed using a set of ontology design criteria. This paper describes a software engineering approach to model domain ontology for occupational therapy resources (OTO) using Natural Language Programming (NLP) technology. The rules were written to annotate the domain concepts using Java Annotation Patterns Engine (JAPE) grammar. It is used to support regular expression matching and thus annotate OT concepts by using the GATE developer tool. This speeds up the time-consuming development of the ontology, which is important for experts in the domain who face time constraints and high workloads. The rules provide significant results: the pattern matching of OT concepts based on the lookup list produced 403 correct concepts and the accuracy was generally higher. Using NLP technique is a good approach to reducing the domain expert’s work, and the results can be evaluated. This study contributes to the understanding of ontology development and evaluation methods to address the knowledge gap of using ontology in the decision support system component of occupational therapy."

Here the aim was to automatically organize textual documents into hierarchical structures for subject browsing. The string-matching approach was tested using a controlled vocabulary (containing pre-selected and pre-defined authorized terms, each corresponding to only one concept). The results imply that an appropriate controlled vocabulary, with a sufficient number of entry terms designating classes, could in itself be a solution for automated classification. Then, if the same controlled vocabulary had an appropriate hierarchical structure, it would at the same time provide a good browsing structure for the collection of automatically classified documents."

Current models of bibliographic entities, such as Functional Requirements for Bibliographical Records (FRBR) and the Bibliographic Framework (BIBFRAME), take inspiration from data-modelling methods developed by computer scientists from the mid-1970s on. Thus, it would seem that the modelling of bibliographic entities is an activity of very recent vintage. However, it is possible to find examples of bibliographical models from earlier periods of knowledge organization. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to one such model, outlined by the early 20th-century British classification theorist E. Wyndham Hulme in his essay on “Principles of Book Classification” (1911–1912). There, Hulme set forth a classification of various attributes by which books can conceivably be classified. These he first divided into accidental and inseparable attributes. Accidental attributes were subdivided into edition-level and copy-level attributes and inseparable attitudes, into physical and non-physical attributes. Comparison of Hulme’s classification of attributes with those of FRBR and BIBFRAME 2.0 reveals that the different classes of attributes in Hulme’s classification correspond to groups of attributes associated with different bibliographical entities in those models. These later models assume the existence of different bibliographic entities in an abstraction hierarchy among which attributes are distributed, whereas Hulme posited only a single entity— the book—, whose various aspects he clustered into different classes of attributes. Thus, Hulme’s model offers an interesting alternative to current assumptions about how to conceptualize the relationship between attributes and entities in the bibliographical universe."

And yet, a question still seems unanswered: how was its literature classified and retrieved? It is a subject that has been given surprisingly little attention by the field of library-and-information science―indeed, by scholarship in general. Furthermore, a certain way of thinking has influenced the few answers that have so far been attempted. It is as if the scholars of our era have tried to identify the modern, physical library in the Hellenistic library in Alexandria. But such an approach is biased in a basic way: It simply does not consider the impact of the cultural and intellectual context of the library. This article differs fundamentally, because I reject the notion that the library was like those of today. Accordingly, an entirely new way of understanding how the library actually worked, in terms of classification and retrieval processes is presented. The key element is to understand the library both as a physical structure and as a struc- ture in the memory of the Alexandrian scholars. In this article, these structures are put together so as to propose a new interpretation of the library."

From the very beginning, UDC was designed to represent the universe of knowledge as an integral whole allowing for subjects/concepts from all fields of knowledge to be combined, linked and the nature of their relationships made explicit. In Otlet's original design, the emphasis for his new type of classification was on the coordination of classmarks at the point of searching, i.e., post-coordination, which he firmly rooted in an expressive notational system. While some UDC classes exhibit various patterns of facet analytical theory proper, others, although used in an analytico-synthetic fashion, follow less canonical structural patterns. The authors highlight the lack of connection made throughout the various stages of UDC restructuring between: a) theoretical requirements of an overarching facet analytical theory as a founding principle guiding the construction of schedules; and, b) practical requirements for an analytico-synthetic classification in terms of notational presentation and data structure that enables its use in indexing and retrieval, as well as its management online."

We take three main sources—user image search behaviour, briefs, and image search engine search facets to examine the search facets for image searching in order to examine the following research question—are search facet schemes for image search engines sufficient for user needs, or is revision needed? We found that there are three main classes of user search facet, which include business, contextual and image related information. The key argument in the paper is that the facet “keyword/tag” is ambiguous and does not support user needs for more generic descriptions to broaden search or specific descriptions to narrow their search — we suggest that a more detailed search facet scheme would be appropriate."

In response, many organizations have deployed some form of enterprise search to improve the ˜findability of information. Debates persist as to whether thesauri and manual indexing or automated machine learning techniques should be used to enhance discovery of information. In addition, the extent to which a Knowledge Organization System (KOS) enhances discoveries or indeed blinds us to new ones remains a moot point. The oil and gas industry is used as a case study using a representative organization. Drawing on prior research, a theoretical model is presented which aims to overcome the shortcomings of each approach. This synergistic model could help re-conceptualize the ˜manual versus ˜automatic debate in many enterprises, accommodating a broader range of information needs. This may enable enterprises to develop more effective information and knowledge management strategies and ease the tension between what is often perceived as mutually exclusive competing approaches.

The conceptual analysis is aided by examples drawn from two classification schemes, British Catalogue of Music Classification (BCMC) and Flexible Classification. First, this exploration reveals that there are conceptually four sub-facets for classifying instrument ensembles, and that the omission of any of these sub-facets causes issues within classification schemes. Next, the different type of relationships between pairs of these sub-facets is delineated, including hierarchical and associative relationships. The classification of ensembles is depicted in a novel way, as a series of inter-connected relationships between sub-facets. Finally, the article ascertains exactly what is being counted, including introducing potential extra sets of sub-facets pertaining to performers and hands. So, facet analysis helps to create a model for classifying instrumental ensembles which provides a novel solution to this historically problematic area of music classification, as well as suggesting a potentially generalizable new way of thinking about complex relationships between sub-facets"

We explore a string-matching algorithm based on a controlled vocabulary, which does not require training documents--instead it reuses the intellectual work put into creating the controlled vocabulary. Terms from the Engineering Information thesaurus and classification scheme were matched against title and abstract of engineering papers from the Compendex database. Simple string-matching was enhanced by several methods such as term weighting schemes and cut-offs, exclusion of certain terms, and enrichment of the controlled vocabulary with automatically extracted terms. The best results are 76% recall when the controlled vocabulary is enriched with new terms, and 79% precision when certain terms are excluded. Precision of individual classes is up to 98%. These results are comparable to state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms."

An e-mail survey was conducted with personnel at LibraryThing, and the results were compared against tags for twenty different fiction books, collected from two different library catalogues with disparate tag cloud sizes, and LibraryThing’s web page. The data were analysed using a modified version of Golder and Huberman’s tag categories (2006). The results show that while LibraryThing claims to only remove the inherently personal tags, several other types of tags are found to have been discarded as well. Occasionally a certain type of tag is included in one book, and excluded in another. The comparison between the two tag cloud sizes suggests that the larger tag clouds provide a more pronounced picture regarding the contents of the book but at the cost of an increase in the number of tags with synonymous or redundant information.</p>"

To provide a foundation for research evaluation from the perspective of innovativeness, we propose an automatic approach for extracting innovative ideas from the abstracts of technology and engineering papers. The approach extracts N-grams as candidates based on part-of-speech tagging and determines whether they are novel by checking the Scopus® database to determine whether they had ever been presented previously. Moreover, we discussed the distributions of innovative ideas in different abstract structures. To improve the performance by excluding noisy N-grams, a list of stop-words and a list of research description characteristics were developed. We selected abstracts of articles published from 2011 to 2017 with the topic of semantic analysis as the experimental texts. Excluding noisy N-grams, considering the distribution of innovative ideas in abstracts, and suitably combining N-grams can effectively improve the performance of automatic innovative idea extraction. Unlike co-word and co-citation analysis, innovative-idea extraction aims to identify the differences in a paper from all previously published papers. </p>"

Hornbostel-Sachs has dominated organological discourse and practice since its creation, and this article analyses the scheme’s context, background, versions and impact. The position of Hornbostel-Sachs in the history and development of instrument classification is explored. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the mechanics of the scheme, including its decimal notation, the influential broad categories of the scheme, its warrant, and its typographical layout. The version history of the scheme is outlined and the relationships between versions is visualised, including its translations, the introduction of the electrophones category, and the Musical Instruments Museums Online (MIMO) version designed for a digital environment. The reception of Hornbostel-Sachs is analysed, and its usage, criticism and impact are all considered. As well as dominating organological research and practice for over a century, it is shown that Hornbostel-Sachs also had a significant influence on the bibliographic classification of music."

The phenomenon of bias or discrimination in machine ethics is seen as inherited from humans, either through the use of biased data or through the semantics inherent in intellectually-built tools sourced by intelligent agents. The kind of biases observed in AI are compared with those identified in the field of knowledge organization, using religious adherents as an example of a community potentially marginalized by bias. A practical demonstration is given of apparent religious prejudice inherited from source material in a large database deployed widely in computational linguistics and automatic indexing. Methods to address the problem of bias are discussed, including the modelling of the moral process on neuroscientific understanding of brain function. The question is posed whether it is possible to model religious belief in a similar way, so that robots of the future may have both an ethical and a religious sense and themselves address the problem of prejudice. </p>"

Facets have traditionally been used to organize document collections and to express complex subjects. In the digital world, they act as filters to facilitate navigation and improve retrieval. But the popularity of the term does not mean that a definitive characterization of the concept has been established. Indeed, several conceptualizations of the facet co-exist.

Archival arrangement represents a form of bricolage that archivists have been practicing for years. By organizing records according to provenance, archivists engage in knowledge creation. Archival theory holds that records are created as an output from social and bureaucratic processes. Archival description, then, could serve as a form of archival record, bearing evidence of the processes of archival arrangement. Current participatory and community-based approaches to archival description urgently require an evidential record of their processes of community consultation and professional mediation. This paper examines two Canadian community-based, participatory archival projects. Project Naming, at Library and Archives Canada, draws upon Inuit community contributions to augment the often sparse and sometimes offensive descriptions of historic photos of arctic peoples. The Sex Work Database at the University of Manitoba, works with sex work activists to create and apply a tagging folksonomy to a collection of websites, organizational records and news media. Analysis of these diverse, community-based projects reveals how current approaches to description make it difficult to distinguish between professional and community contributions to arrangement and description, and proposes ways to make such contributions more apparent. </p>"

The current instantiation of the classification dates from 2015. The classification is currently made up of two classes—D for the sciences broadly, and E for interdisciplinary areas. The NARCIS Classification is designed specifically and with care for the contents of the NARCIS data portal. The classification mostly represents the sciences. A few anomalous situations are visible in the ontology of the classification: the humanities occupy one division within the sciences, placed between the life sciences and law; and, the treatment of interdisciplinarity, for which a separate class E is set aside for interdisciplinary sciences. A dump of the NARCIS database was used to analyze the population of the NARCIS classification. The life sciences occupy 34% of the NARCIS database. A framework for research networking systems reveals the NARCIS database and its classification most objectives, with the only lapse being the output of entities and attributes to ontologies. The NARCIS Classification is also an occupational classification. The NARCIS classification supports a vital research portal that, in turn, supports a nationally-coordinated research effort designed to provide better inter-institutional communication of scholarly productivity, thus is in itself an information institution, in which domain-dependence is part of its cultural imperative. The NARCIS Classification incorporates an example of top-down politics in which funded disciplines are included and best represented. A perhaps unintended consequence is the encapsulation of forced views. Trajectories for further discussion with regard to continued development of the NARCIS Classification include identity, interoperability, interdisciplinarity, and synthesis."

HCFOC uses the human-centric approach, improvised with the idea of selective dissemination of information (SDI), to deal with context. Further, this ontology construction process makes use of facet analysis and an analytico-synthetic classification approach. This novel fusion contributes to the originality of HCFOC and distinguishes it from other existing ontology construction methodologies. Based on HCFOC, an ontology of the tourism domain has been designed using the Protégé-5.5.0 ontology editor. The HCFOC methodology has provided the necessary flexibility, extensibility, robustness and has facilitated the capturing of background knowledge. It models the tourism ontology in such a way that it is able to deal with the context of a tourist’s information need with precision. This is evident from the result that more than 90% of the user’s queries were successfully met. The use of domain knowledge and techniques from both library and information science and computer science has helped in the realization of the desired purpose of this ontology construction process. It is envisaged that HCFOC will have implications for ontology developers. The demonstrated tourism ontology can support any tourism information retrieval system. </p>"

The primary challenge in the analysis of fictional content is that there is no single meaning to be analysed; the analysis is an ongoing process involving an interaction between the text produced by author, the reader and the society in which the interaction occurs. Furthermore, different audiences have specific needs to be taken into consideration. This article explores the topic of fiction knowledge organization, including both classification and indexing. It provides a broad and analytical overview of the literature as well as describing several experimental approaches and developmental projects for the analysis of fictional content. Traditional fiction indexing has been mainly based on the factual aspects of the work; this has then been expanded to handle different aspects of the fictional work. There have been attempts made to develop vocabularies for fiction indexing. All the major classification schemes use the genre and language/culture of fictional works when subdividing fictional works into subclasses. The evolution of shelf classification of fiction and the appearance of different types of digital tools have revolutionized the classification of fiction, making it possible to integrate both indexing and classification of fictional works.</p>"

In order to better understand this trend, the researchers interviewed seven school librarians regarding their motivations for genrefying their libraries’ fiction collections; the challenges they encountered during or after the genrefication process; and any benefits they perceived as having resulted in the implementation of genrefication. The data suggest that the librarians’ interests in genrefication stem mostly from the lack of time they have to help individual students find materials, and the lack of time students are given out of the instructional day to explore the libraries’ fiction collections. The participants felt that reclassifying the library’s fiction collection by genre gave students more ownership of the fiction collection and allowed them to find materials that genuinely interested them. The significant challenges the librarians faced in the reorganization process speak to challenges regarding the ways in which librarians attempt to provide access to diverse materials for all patrons. </p>"

Who is participating in this discipline’s scholarly discussion, and from what locations, both geographically and intellectually? Using the unit of authorship in the journal Knowledge Organization, where is the nexus of KO activity and what patterns of authorship can be identified? Cultural characteristics were applied as a lens to explore who is and is not participating in the international conversation about KO.

A work consists of abstract intellectual content that is distinct from any object that is its carrier. In library and information science, the importance of the work lies squarely with the problem of information retrieval. Works are mentefacts-intellectual (or mental) constructs that serve as artifacts of the cultures in which they arise. The meaning of a work is abstract at every level, from its creator’s conception of it, to its reception and inherence by its consumers. Works are a kind of informing object and are subject to the phenomenon of instantiation, or realization over time. Research has indicated a base typology of instantiation. The problem for information retrieval is to simultaneously collocate and disambiguate large sets of instantiations.

The classification has two main sources of inspiration: Comte’s science classification and Kant’s theoretical philosophy. Peirce’s classification, like that of Comte, is hierarchically organised in that the more general and abstract sciences provide principles for the less general and more concrete sciences. However, Peirce includes and assigns a superordinate role to philosophical disciplines which analyse and provide logical, methodological and ontological principles for the specialised sciences, and which are based on everyday life experience. Moreover, Peirce recognises two main branches of specialised empirical science: the natural sciences, on the one hand, and the social sciences, the humanities and psychology on the other. While both branches share logical and methodological principles, they are based on different ontological principles in studying physical nature and the human mind and its products, respectively. Peirce’s most basic philosophical discipline, phenomenology, transforms his early engagement with Kant. Peirce’s classification of aesthetics, ethics and logic as normative sub-disciplines of philosophy relate to his philosophical pragmatism. Yet his more overarching division between theoretical (philosophical and specialised) sciences and practical sciences may be seen as problematic. Taking Peirce’s historical account of scientific developments into consideration, however, I argue that his science classification and its emphasis on the interdependencies between the sciences could be seen as sustaining and supporting interdisciplinarity and interaction across fields of research, even across the divide between theoretical and practical sciences. </p>"

The study includes a literature review and epistemological analysis. It provides a preliminary analysis of history in two selected universal Polish KOSs: KABA subject headings and the National Library of Poland Descriptors. The research is restricted to the high-level concept of historiographical metaphors coined by Wojciech Wrzosek and how they can be utilized in analyzing KOSs. The analysis of the structure of the KOSs and indexing practices of selected history books is performed. A particular emphasis is placed upon the requirements of classical and non-classical historiography in the context of KO. Although the knowledge about historiographical metaphors given by Wrzosek can be helpful for the analysis and improvement of KOSs, it seems that their broad character can provide the creators only with some general guidelines. Historical research is multidimensional, which is why the general remarks presented in this article need to be supplemented with in-depth theoretical and empirical analyses of historiography.</p>"

The aim of this article is to encourage and facilitate further reflections on academic disciplines, while at the same time offering insights on how this elusive concept might be understood. An overarching argument is that “discipline” should foremost be understood in relation to institutional and organisational features, and this is what distinguishes it from related terms such as, field, domain or topic. The etymology and history of the concept are reviewed along with a discussion of attempts to define and conceptualise disciplines. Insights are offered on how disciplines might be studied. Regardless of our views of disciplines, either as inherently out-dated constructs or as important features of a well-functioning academia, it is concluded that further precision or care in explicating the concept is needed. </p>"

This paper intends to introduce initial notes and comments to advance towards an overall conception of the warrant notion. For this purpose, the expression “warrant” is studied as a word of the general language as well as a term of specialized languages. Then, the scope of application of the warrants is established. Next, each warrant is placed in one of the approaches proposed by Hjørland to categorize theories and methods (empiricism, rationalism, historicism and pragmatism). From the above, some lines of research problems are identified.

Fine-grained ontology is used to describe synonymous expressions of product features, which are reflected in word changes in online reviews. First, a semiautomatic construction method is developed by using Word2Vec for fine-grained ontology. Then, feature-level sentiment analysis that combines rules parsing and the fine-grained domain ontology is conducted to extract explicit and implicit features from product reviews. Finally, the domain sentiment dictionary and context sentiment dictionary are established to identify sentiment polarities for the extracted feature-sentiment combinations. An experiment is conducted on the basis of product reviews crawled from Chinese e-commerce websites. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. </p>"

These questions are considered through a discussion of classification structures, personal classification, the link of classification to theory, everyday working classifications, translation of classifications, cognitive aspects, browsing, genres, warrant, and the difficulties of navigating complex ontological commitments. The through thread is the importance of context, because classifications can only be seen with respect to the human endeavors that generate them. </p>"

He can be read for well-informed critiques of the instruments by which writings are organized for retrieval-the bibliographical side of KO. He can also be read for shrewd accounts of personal knowledge and behavior with respect to societal information systems-the social-epistemological side of KO. Indeed, in his work the two sides converge. One of his themes is the preferability of human consultants over bibliographies and catalogs for answering questions. He thus writes at length about the social organization of possible consultants and their degrees of cognitive authority in communicating what they know. Another theme is the desirability of indexing writings not only by subject but also by their possible utility in helping individuals. For that, however, he saw little hope. A third theme is ideal information systems.

What is a work about? How can this be known? This mirrors debates within the philosophy of language, where the concept of representation has similarly evaded satisfactory definition. This paper proposes that we abandon the strong sense of the word aboutness, which seems to promise some inherent relationship between work and subject, or between word and world. Instead, we seek an etymological reset to the sense of aboutness of “in the vicinity, nearby; in some place or various places nearby; all over a surface.” To distinguish this sense, we introduce the term episemantics. The authors have each independently applied this term in slightly different contexts and scales (Hauser 2018a; J. T. Tennis 2016), and this article presents a unified definition of the term and guidelines for applying it at the scale of both words and works. The resulting weak concept of aboutness is pragmatic, in Star’s sense of a focus on consequences over antecedents, while reserving space for the critique and improvement of aboutness determinations within various contexts and research programs. The paper finishes with a discussion of the implication of the concept of episemantics and methodological possibilities it offers for knowledge organization research and practice."

In the preliminary results, we have defined instance-based and schema-based categories of semantic enrichment. In the instance-based category, in which enrichment occurs by enhancing the content of entities, we further determined three types, including: 1) enriching the entities by linking to diverse external resources in order to provide additional data of multiple perspectives; 2) enriching the entities with missing data, which is needed to satisfy the semantic queries; and, 3) providing the entities with access to an extended knowledge base. In the schema-based categories that enrichment occurs by enhancing the relations between the properties, we have identified two types, including: 1) enriching the properties by defining the hierarchical relations between properties; and, 2) specifying properties’ domain and range for data reasoning. In addition, the study implements the LOD dataset in a digital humanities platform to demonstrate how instances and entities can be applied in the full texts where the relationship between entities are highlighted in order to bring scholars more semantic details of the texts. </p>"

The NARCIS Classification assigns symbols to represent the knowledge-bases of contributing scholars. A recent research stream in knowledge organization known as comparative classification uses two or more classifications experimentally to generate empirical evidence about coverage of conceptual content, population of the classes, and economy of classification. This paper builds on that research in order to further understand the comparative impact of the NARCIS Classification alongside a classification designed specifically for information resources. Our six cases come from the DANS project Knowledge Organi- zation System Observatory (KOSo), which itself is classified using the Information Coding Classification (ICC) created in 1982 by Ingetraut Dahlberg. ICC is considered to have the merits of universality, faceting, and a top-down approach. Results are exploratory, indicating that both classifications provide fairly precise coverage. The inflexibility of the NARCIS Classification makes it difficult to express complex concepts. The meta-ontological, epistemic stance of the ICC is apparent in all aspects of this study. Using the two together in the DANS KOS Observatory will provide users with both clarity of scientific positioning and ontological relativity."

We examine the ways in which information architecture and organizational theory can surface the inner workings of music in a relatable and approachable way. We consider music as a series of design resources that composers draw upon and organize according to a series of constraints that create a sense of musical structure to which the listener can relate. After a general introduction to the literature relating to constraints and creativity, we use two historical anecdotes that provide accessible demonstrations of how musicians in the seventeenth and twentieth centuries organized their musical resources both for their own compositional needs and for the purposes of didactic communication. </p>"

Since then, provenance and document context have supported the organization of archival knowledge (especially through classification and description procedures). Such relationships were gradually refined over the years and from different experiences between European archives and their classification and ordering systems. Historically, the principle of provenance is a pivotal moment in the development of archival theory, crucial to understanding the nature of records and archives. However, in archival theory, the principle of provenance still does not correspond to a single term or a single definition and scarce normalization terminology remains one of the problems of archival science, which leads to a lack of consensus about the division between the two principles of provenance and original order. Recently, the concept of provenance has been addressed by many other disciplines (law, library and information science, computer science and visual analytics) and applied to different domains (cloud-based storage, preservation of digital records, digital evidence, digital humanities, e-science, open data, linked data, knowledge organization and indexing. As the use of provenance reaches new domains it is no longer just an organizing principle but also a means of reaching for authenticity and reliability of data and objects in digital environments or museums or to reestablish the original organic relationship in library collections. </p>"

The representation of information is associated with classification and retrieval of information to the organization of knowledge in information science. There is a gap in the archival area regarding the expression representation of information from the description of the nineteenth century. As for the theoretical-methodological aspect, there was a theoretical survey of the representation of information in publications in the interdisciplinary areas; as to the operational methodology, questionnaires were applied to information agencies on the use of controlled vocabularies, in relation to the treatment of information in archival collections. We conclude by demonstrating the importance of adopting the concept of information representation in archives, using controlled vocabularies associated with new information technologies and informational ecology, consolidating the area as a scientific and interdisciplinary field for information science. </p>"

The study was conducted in two stages: i) literature identification, where the systematic literature review methodology was employed; and, ii) ontological review, where the parametric approach was applied. The study resulted in a set of fourteen papers discussing the flood ontology (FO). The ontological review revealed that most of the flood ontologies were task ontologies, formal, modular, and used web ontology language (OWL) for their representation. The most (re)used ontologies were SWEET, SSN, Time, and Space. METHONTOLOGY was the preferred design methodology, and for evaluation, application-based or data-based approaches were preferred. The majority of the ontologies were built around the response phase of the disaster. The unavailability of the full ontologies somewhat restricted the current study as the structural ontology metrics are missing. But the scientific community, the developers, of flood disaster management systems can refer to this work for their research to see what is available in the literature on flood ontology and the other major domains essential in building the FO. </p>"

The aim is to systematize the relations between knowledge organization and archival science within the scope of classification and description. Bibliographic research in ISKO literature and archival literature was performed. Through systematization, it was possible to understand how the relationship between these fields is carried out and how it can be strengthened. The field of knowledge organization makes a pivotal contribution to the development of methodologies to access information. A series of developments in languages, structures and classifications, that is, knowledge organization systems (KOSs), is presented. On the other hand, archival science has been developing simultaneously, but in many moments seeking interlocutions, although superficial or even unintentional with the field of knowledge organization. The approximation of these fields is essential for the development of archival classification and description, aiming for the construction of ontologies, taxonomies and controlled vocabularies among others. These recent approximations must have occurred due to the changes that have happened in the last twenty years in relation to records management and the way people build knowledge and seek information. Also, it is possible to apply KOSs in the administrative digital environment for better archival representation instruments.  </p>"

The domain that has been chosen is human nervous system (HNS) disorders. It is hypothesized here that an ontology-based patient records management system is more effective in meeting and addressing complex information needs of health-care personnel. Therefore, this study has been based on the premise that developing an ontology and using it as a component of the search interface in hospital records management systems will lead to more efficient and effective management of health-care. It is proposed here to develop an ontology of the domain of HNS disorders using a standard vocabulary such as MeSH or SNOMED CT. The principal classes of an ontology include facet analysis for arranging concepts based on their common characteristics to build mutually exclusive classes. We combine faceted theory with description logic, which helps us to better query and retrieve data by implementing an ontological model. Protégé 5.2.0 was used as ontology editor. The use of ontologies for domain modelling will be of acute help to doctors for searching patient records. In this paper we show how the faceted approach helps us to build a flexible model and retrieve better information. We use the medical domain as a case study to show examples and implementation. </p>"

Diverse UGC sources and information overload are making it increasingly difficult to satisfy personalized information needs. To organize UGCs in a user-centered way, we should not only map them based on textual topics but also link them with users and even user communities. We propose a multi-dimensional framework to organize information by connecting UGCs, users, and user communities. First, we use a topic model to generate a topic hierarchy from UGCs. Second, an author-topic model is applied to learn user interests. Third, user communities are detected through a label propagation algorithm. Finally, a multi-dimensional information organization pattern is formulated based on similarities among the topic hierarchies of UGCs, user interests, and user communities. The results reveal that: 1) our proposed framework can organize information from multiple sources in a user-centered way; 2) hierarchical topic structures can provide comprehensive and in-depth topics for users; and, 3) user communities are efficient in helping people to connect with others who have similar interests.</p>"

What is a work about? How can this be known? This mirrors debates within the philosophy of language, where the concept of representation has similarly evaded satisfactory definition. This paper proposes that we abandon the strong sense of the word aboutness, which seems to promise some inherent relationship between work and subject, or, in philosophical terms, between word and world. Instead, we seek an etymological reset to the older sense of aboutness as “in the vicinity, nearby; in some place or various places nearby; all over a surface.” To distinguish this sense in the context of information studies, we introduce the term episemantics. The authors have each independently applied this term in slightly different contexts and scales (Hauser 2018a; Tennis 2016), and this article presents a unified definition of the term and guidelines for applying it at the scale of both words and works. The resulting weak concept of aboutness is pragmatic, in Star’s sense of a focus on consequences over antecedents, while reserving space for the critique and improvement of aboutness determinations within various contexts and research programs. The paper finishes with a discussion of the implication of the concept of episemantics and methodological possibilities it offers for knowledge organization research and practice. We draw inspiration from Melvil Dewey’s use of physical aroundness in his first classification system and ask how aroundness might be more effectively operationalized in digital environments. </p>"

Whereas most universal schemes are organized around scholarly disciplines, the BCC is instead organized around phenomena (things), the relationships that exist among phenomena, and the properties that phenomena and relators may possess. This structure allows the BCC to apply facet analysis without requiring the use of “facet indicators.” The main motivation for the BCC was a recognition that existing classifications that are organized around disciplines serve interdisciplinary scholarship poorly. Complex concepts that might be understood quite differently across groups and individuals can generally be broken into basic concepts for which there is enough shared understanding for the purposes of classification. Documents, ideas, and objects are classified synthetically by combining entries from the schedules of phenomena, relators, and properties. The inclusion of separate schedules of-generally verb-like-relators is one of the most unusual aspects of the BCC. This (and the schedules of properties that serve as adjectives or adverbs) allows the production of sentence-like subject strings. Documents can then be classified in terms of the main arguments made in the document. BCC provides very precise descriptors of documents by combining phenomena, relators, and properties synthetically. The terminology employed in the BCC reduces terminological ambiguity. The BCC is still being developed and it needs to be fleshed out in certain respects. Yet it also needs to be applied; only in application can the feasibility and desirability of the classification be adequately assessed. </p>"

The research questions are: 1) How can we keep the original rich and contextual information of the archival materials during a LOD task?; 2) How can we integrate heterogeneous datasets about the same real-world resources from libraries, archives, and museums, while keeping the different views distinct?; and, (3) How can we provide added value for semantic metadata of archives in terms of instance-based and schema-based types of enrichment? The project adopts the Europeana Data Model (EDM) as the main model and extends the properties to fit the contextual characteristics of archival materials. Various methods are explored to preserve the hierarchical structure and context of the archival materials, to enrich semantic data, and to connect data from different sources and institutions. We propose four approaches to enriching data semantics by: 1) directly using external vocabularies; 2) reconciling local links to other linked data sources; 3) introducing contextual classes for the appropriate contextual entities; and, 4) utilizing named entity extraction. The results can contribute to the best practice for developing linked data for art-related archival materials. </p>"

Given its inherent interdisciplinarity, we ask what might a map of the physical, cultural and intellectual geography of the KO community look like? Who is participating in this discipline’s scholarly discussion, and from what locations, both geographically and intellectually? Using the unit of authorship in the journal Knowledge Organization, where is the nexus of KO activity, and what patterns of authorship can be identified? What indices can be generated to describe the KO community of researchers as it has evolved? Cultural characteristics were applied as a lens to explore who is and is not participating in the international conversation about KO. World Bank GNI per capita estimates were used to compare relative wealth of countries and Hofstede’s Individualism dimension was identified as a way of understanding attributes of countries whose scholars are participating in this dialog. Descriptive statistics were generated through Excel, and data visualizations were rendered through Tableau Public and TagCrowd. The current project offers one method for examining an international and interdisciplinary field of study, but also suggests potential for analyzing other interdisciplinary areas within the larger discipline of information science."
